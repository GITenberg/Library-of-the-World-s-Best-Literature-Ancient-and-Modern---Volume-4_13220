<h2>GEORGE BANCROFT (Continued from Volume III)</h2>
<h3>WOLFE ON THE PLAINS OF ABRAHAM</h3>
<center>From 'History of the United States'</center>
<p>But, in the meantime, Wolfe applied himself intently to
reconnoitering the north shore above Quebec. Nature had given him
good eyes, as well as a warmth of temper to follow first
impressions. He himself discovered the cove which now bears his
name, where the bending promontories almost form a basin, with a
very narrow margin, over which the hill rises precipitously. He saw
the path that wound up the steep, though so narrow that two men
could hardly march in it abreast; and he knew, by the number of
tents which he counted on the summit, that the Canadian post which
guarded it could not exceed a hundred. Here he resolved to land his
army by surprise. To mislead the enemy, his troops were kept far
above the town; while Saunders, as if an attack was intended at
Beauport, set Cook, the great mariner, with others, to sound the
water and plant buoys along that shore.</p>
<p>The day and night of the twelfth were employed in preparations.
The autumn evening was bright; and the general, under the clear
starlight, visited his stations, to make his final inspection and
utter his last words of encouragement. As he passed from ship to
ship, he spoke to those in the boat with him of the poet Gray, and
the 'Elegy in a Country Churchyard.' "I," said he, "would prefer
being the author of that poem to the glory of beating the French
to-morrow;" and, while the oars struck the river as it rippled in
the silence of the night air under the flowing tide, he
repeated:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">"The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,</p>
<p class="i5">And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,</p>
<p class="i4">Await alike the inevitable hour--</p>
<p class="i5">The paths of glory lead but to the grave."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Every officer knew his appointed duty, when, at one o'clock in
the morning of the thirteenth of September, Wolfe, Monckton, and
Murray, and about half the forces, set off in boats, and, using
neither sail nor oars, glided down with the tide. In three quarters
of an hour the ships followed; and, though the night had become
dark, aided by the rapid current, they reached the cove just in
time to cover the landing. Wolfe and the troops with him leaped on
shore; the light infantry, who found themselves borne by the
current a little below the intrenched path, clambered up the steep
hill, staying themselves by the roots and boughs of the maple and
spruce and ash trees that covered the precipitous declivity, and,
after a little firing, dispersed the picket which guarded the
height; the rest ascended safely by the pathway. A battery of four
guns on the left was abandoned to Colonel Howe. When Townshend's
division disembarked, the English had already gained one of the
roads to Quebec; and, advancing in front of the forest, Wolfe stood
at daybreak with his invincible battalions on the Plains of
Abraham, the battle-field of the Celtic and Saxon races.</p>
<p>"It can be but a small party, come to burn a few houses and
retire," said Montcalm, in amazement as the news reached him in his
intrenchments the other side of the St. Charles; but, obtaining
better information, "Then," he cried, "they have at last got to the
weak side of this miserable garrison; we must give battle and crush
them before mid-day." And, before ten, the two armies, equal in
numbers, each being composed of less than five thousand men, were
ranged in presence of one another for battle. The English, not
easily accessible from intervening shallow ravines and rail fences,
were all regulars, perfect in discipline, terrible in their
fearless enthusiasm, thrilling with pride at their morning's
success, commanded by a man whom they obeyed with confidence and
love. The doomed and devoted Montcalm had what Wolfe had called but
"five weak French battalions," of less than two thousand men,
"mingled with disorderly peasantry," formed on commanding ground.
The French had three little pieces of artillery; the English, one
or two. The two armies cannonaded each other for nearly an hour;
when Montcalm, having summoned De Bougainville to his aid, and
dispatched messenger after messenger for De Vaudreuil, who had
fifteen hundred men at the camp, to come up before he should be
driven from the ground, endeavored to flank the British and crowd
them down the high bank of the river. Wolfe counteracted the
movement by detaching Townshend with Amherst's regiment, and
afterward a part of the Royal Americans, who formed on the left
with a double front.</p>
<p>Waiting no longer for more troops, Montcalm led the French army
impetuously to the attack. The ill-disciplined companies broke by
their precipitation and the unevenness of the ground; and fired by
platoons, without unity. Their adversaries, especially the
Forty-third and the Forty-seventh, where Monckton stood, of which
three men out of four were Americans, received the shock with
calmness; and after having, at Wolfe's command, reserved their fire
till their enemy was within forty yards, their line began a
regular, rapid, and exact discharge of musketry. Montcalm was
present everywhere, braving danger, wounded, but cheering by his
example. The second in command, De Sennezergues, an associate in
glory at Ticonderoga, was killed. The brave but untried Canadians,
flinching from a hot fire in the open field, began to waver; and,
so soon as Wolfe, placing himself at the head of the Twenty-eighth
and the Louisburg grenadiers, charged with bayonets, they
everywhere gave way. Of the English officers, Carleton was wounded;
Barr&eacute;, who fought near Wolfe, received in the head a ball
which made him blind of one eye, and ultimately of both. Wolfe,
also, as he led the charge, was wounded in the wrist; but still
pressing forward, he received a second ball; and having decided the
day, was struck a third time, and mortally, in the breast. "Support
me," he cried to an officer near him; "let not my brave fellows see
me drop." He was carried to the rear, and they brought him water to
quench his thirst. "They run! they run!" spoke the officer on whom
he leaned. "Who run?" asked Wolfe, as his life was fast ebbing.
"The French," replied the officer, "give way everywhere." "What,"
cried the expiring hero, "do they run already? Go, one of you, to
Colonel Burton; bid him march Webb's regiment with all speed to
Charles River to cut off the fugitives." Four days before, he had
looked forward to early death with dismay. "Now, God be praised, I
die happy." These were his words as his spirit escaped in the blaze
of his glory. Night, silence, the rushing tide, veteran discipline,
the sure inspiration of genius, had been his allies; his
battle-field, high over the ocean river, was the grandest theatre
for illustrious deeds; his victory, one of the most momentous in
the annals of mankind, gave to the English tongue and the
institutions of the Germanic race the unexplored and seemingly
infinite West and South. He crowded into a few hours actions that
would have given lustre to length of life; and, filling his day
with greatness, completed it before its noon.</p>

<center><b>LEXINGTON</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'History of the United States'</center>
<br>
<p>Day came in all the beauty of an early spring. The trees were
budding; the grass growing rankly a full month before its time; the
bluebird and the robin gladdening the genial season, and calling
forth the beams of the sun which on that morning shone with the
warmth of summer; but distress and horror gathered over the
inhabitants of the peaceful town. There on the green lay in death
the gray-haired and the young; the grassy field was red "with the
innocent blood of their brethren slain," crying unto God for
vengeance from the ground.</p>
<p>Seven of the men of Lexington were killed, nine wounded; a
quarter part of all who stood in arms on the green. These are the
village heroes, who were more than of noble blood, proving by their
spirit that they were of a race divine. They gave their lives in
testimony to the rights of mankind, bequeathing to their country an
assurance of success in the mighty struggle which they began. Their
names are held in grateful remembrance, and the expanding millions
of their countrymen renew and multiply their praise from generation
to generation. They fulfilled their duty not from the accidental
impulse of the moment; their action was the slowly ripened fruit of
Providence and of time. The light that led them on was combined of
rays from the whole history of the race; from the traditions of the
Hebrews in the gray of the world's morning; from the heroes and
sages of republican Greece and Rome; from the example of Him who
died on the cross for the life of humanity; from the religious
creed which proclaimed the divine presence in man, and on this
truth, as in a life-boat, floated the liberties of nations over the
dark flood of the Middle Ages; from the customs of the Germans
transmitted out of their forests to the councils of Saxon England;
from the burning faith and courage of Martin Luther; from trust in
the inevitable universality of God's sovereignty as taught by Paul
of Tarsus and Augustine, through Calvin and the divines of New
England; from the avenging fierceness of the Puritans, who dashed
the mitre on the ruins of the throne; from the bold dissent and
creative self-assertion of the earliest emigrants to Massachusetts;
from the statesmen who made, and the philosophers who expounded,
the revolution of England; from the liberal spirit and analyzing
inquisitiveness of the eighteenth century; from the cloud of
witnesses of all the ages to the reality and the rightfulness of
human freedom. All the centuries bowed themselves from the recesses
of the past to cheer in their sacrifice the lowly men who proved
themselves worthy of their forerunners, and whose children rise up
and call them blessed.</p>
<p>Heedless of his own danger, Samuel Adams, with the voice of a
prophet, exclaimed: "Oh, what a glorious morning is this!" for he
saw his country's independence hastening on, and, like Columbus in
the tempest, knew that the storm did but bear him the more swiftly
toward the undiscovered world.</p>

<center><b>WASHINGTON</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'History of the United States'</center>
<br>
<p>Then, on the fifteenth of June, it was voted to appoint a
general. Thomas Johnson, of Maryland, nominated George Washington;
and as he had been brought forward "at the particular request of
the people of New England," he was elected by ballot
unanimously.</p>
<p>Washington was then forty-three years of age. In stature he a
little exceeded six feet; his limbs were sinewy and
well-proportioned; his chest broad; his figure stately, blending
dignity of presence with ease. His robust constitution had been
tried and invigorated by his early life in the wilderness, the
habit of occupation out of doors, and rigid temperance; so that few
equaled him in strength of arm, or power of endurance, or noble
horsemanship. His complexion was florid; his hair dark brown; his
head in its shape perfectly round. His broad nostrils seemed formed
to give expression and escape to scornful anger. His eyebrows were
rayed and finely arched. His dark-blue eyes, which were deeply set,
had an expression of resignation, and an earnestness that was
almost pensiveness. His forehead was sometimes marked with thought,
but never with inquietude; his countenance was mild and pleasing
and full of benignity.</p>
<p>At eleven years old left an orphan to the care of an excellent
but unlettered mother, he grew up without learning. Of arithmetic
and geometry he acquired just knowledge enough to be able to
practice measuring land; but all his instruction at school taught
him not so much as the orthography or rules of grammar of his own
tongue. His culture was altogether his own work, and he was in the
strictest sense a self-made man; yet from his early life he never
seemed uneducated. At sixteen, he went into the wilderness as a
surveyor, and for three years continued the pursuit, where the
forests trained him, in meditative solitude, to freedom and
largeness of mind; and nature revealed to him her obedience to
serene and silent laws. In his intervals from toil, he seemed
always to be attracted to the best men, and to be cherished by
them. Fairfax, his employer, an Oxford scholar, already aged,
became his fast friend. He read little, but with close attention.
Whatever he took in hand he applied himself to with care; and his
papers, which have been preserved, show how he almost imperceptibly
gained the power of writing correctly; always expressing himself
with clearness and directness, often with felicity of language and
grace.</p>
<p>When the frontiers on the west became disturbed, he at nineteen
was commissioned an adjutant-general with the rank of major. At
twenty-one, he went as the envoy of Virginia to the council of
Indian chiefs on the Ohio, and to the French officers near Lake
Erie. Fame waited upon him from his youth; and no one of his colony
was so much spoken of. He conducted the first military expedition
from Virginia that crossed the Alleghanies. Braddock selected him
as an aid, and he was the only man who came out of the disastrous
defeat near the Monongahela, with increased reputation, which
extended to England. The next year, when he was but
four-and-twenty, "the great esteem" in which he was held in
Virginia, and his "real merit," led the lieutenant-governor of
Maryland to request that he might be "commissioned and appointed
second in command" of the army designed to march to the Ohio; and
Shirley, the commander-in-chief, heard the proposal "with great
satisfaction and pleasure," for "he knew no provincial officer upon
the continent to whom he would so readily give that rank as to
Washington." In 1758 he acted under Forbes as a brigadier, and but
for him that general would never have crossed the mountains.</p>
<p>Courage was so natural to him that it was hardly spoken of to
his praise; no one ever at any moment of his life discovered in him
the least shrinking in danger; and he had a hardihood of daring
which escaped notice, because it was so enveloped by superior
calmness and wisdom.</p>
<p>His address was most easy and agreeable; his step firm and
graceful; his air neither grave nor familiar. He was as cheerful as
he was spirited, frank and communicative in the society of friends,
fond of the fox-chase and the dance, often sportive in his letters,
and liked a hearty laugh. "His smile," writes Chastellux, "was
always the smile of benevolence." This joyousness of disposition
remained to the last, though the vastness of his responsibilities
was soon to take from him the right of displaying the impulsive
qualities of his nature, and the weight which he was to bear up was
to overlay and repress his gayety and openness.</p>
<p>His hand was liberal; giving quietly and without observation, as
though he was ashamed of nothing but being discovered in doing
good. He was kindly and compassionate, and of lively sensibility to
the sorrows of others; so that, if his country had only needed a
victim for its relief, he would have willingly offered himself as a
sacrifice. But while he was prodigal of himself, he was considerate
for others; ever parsimonious of the blood of his countrymen.</p>
<p>He was prudent in the management of his private affairs,
purchased rich lands from the Mohawk valley to the flats of the
Kanawha, and improved his fortune by the correctness of his
judgment; but, as a public man, he knew no other aim than the good
of his country, and in the hour of his country's poverty he refused
personal emolument for his service.</p>
<p>His faculties were so well balanced and combined that his
constitution, free from excess, was tempered evenly with all the
elements of activity, and his mind resembled a well-ordered
commonwealth; his passions, which had the intensest vigor, owned
allegiance to reason; and with all the fiery quickness of his
spirit, his impetuous and massive will was held in check by
consummate judgment. He had in his composition a calm, which gave
him in moments of highest excitement the power of self-control, and
enabled him to excel in patience, even when he had most cause for
disgust. Washington was offered a command when there was little to
bring out the unorganized resources of the continent but his own
influence, and authority was connected with the people by the most
frail, most attenuated, scarcely discernible threads; yet, vehement
as was his nature, impassioned as was his courage, he so retained
his ardor that he never failed continuously to exert the attractive
power of that influence, and never exerted it so sharply as to
break its force.</p>
<p>In secrecy he was unsurpassed; but his secrecy had the character
of prudent reserve, not of cunning or concealment. His great
natural power of vigilance had been developed by his life in the
wilderness.</p>
<p>His understanding was lucid, and his judgment accurate; so that
his conduct never betrayed hurry or confusion. No detail was too
minute for his personal inquiry and continued supervision; and at
the same time he comprehended events in their widest aspects and
relations. He never seemed above the object that engaged his
attention, and he was always equal, without an effort, to the
solution of the highest questions, even when there existed no
precedents to guide his decision. In the perfection of the
reflective powers, which he used habitually, he had no peer.</p>
<p>In this way he never drew to himself admiration for the
possession of any one quality in excess, never made in council any
one suggestion that was sublime but impracticable, never in action
took to himself the praise or the blame of undertakings astonishing
in conception, but beyond his means of execution. It was the most
wonderful accomplishment of this man that, placed upon the largest
theatre of events, at the head of the greatest revolution in human
affairs, he never failed to observe all that was possible, and at
the same time to bound his aspirations by that which was
possible.</p>
<p>A slight tinge in his character, perceptible only to the close
observer, revealed the region from which he sprung, and he might be
described as the best specimen of manhood as developed in the
South; but his qualities were so faultlessly proportioned that his
whole country rather claimed him as its choicest representative,
the most complete expression of all its attainments and
aspirations. He studied his country and conformed to it. His
countrymen felt that he was the best type of America, and rejoiced
in it, and were proud of it. They lived in his life, and made his
success and his praise their own.</p>
<p>Profoundly impressed with confidence in God's providence, and
exemplary in his respect for the forms of public worship, no
philosopher of the eighteenth century was more firm in the support
of freedom of religious opinion, none more remote from bigotry; but
belief in God, and trust in his overruling power, formed the
essence of his character. Divine wisdom not only illumines the
spirit, it inspires the will. Washington was a man of action, and
not of theory or words; his creed appears in his life, not in his
professions, which burst from him very rarely, and only at those
great moments of crisis in the fortunes of his country, when earth
and heaven seemed actually to meet, and his emotions became too
intense for suppression; but his whole being was one continued act
of faith in the eternal, intelligent, moral order of the universe.
Integrity was so completely the law of his nature, that a planet
would sooner have shot from its sphere than he have departed from
his uprightness, which was so constant that it often seemed to be
almost impersonal. "His integrity was the most pure, his justice
the most inflexible I have ever known," writes Jefferson; "no
motives of interest or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred,
being able to bias his decision."</p>
<p>They say of Giotto that he introduced goodness into the art of
painting; Washington carried it with him to the camp and the
Cabinet, and established a new criterion of human greatness. The
purity of his will confirmed his fortitude: and as he never
faltered in his faith in virtue, he stood fast by that which he
knew to be just; free from illusions; never dejected by the
apprehension of the difficulties and perils that went before him,
and drawing the promise of success from the justice of his cause.
Hence he was persevering, leaving nothing unfinished; devoid of all
taint of obstinacy in his firmness; seeking and gladly receiving
advice, but immovable in his devotedness to right.</p>
<p>Of a "retiring modesty and habitual reserve," his ambition was
no more than the consciousness of his power, and was subordinate to
his sense of duty; he took the foremost place, for he knew from
inborn magnanimity that it belonged to him, and he dared not
withhold the service required of him; so that, with all his
humility, he was by necessity the first, though never for himself
or for private ends. He loved fame, the approval of coming
generations, the good opinion of his fellow-men of his own time,
and he desired to make his conduct coincide with his wishes; but
not fear of censure, not the prospect of applause could tempt him
to swerve from rectitude, and the praise which he coveted was the
sympathy of that moral sentiment which exists in every human
breast, and goes forth only to the welcome of virtue.</p>
<p>There have been soldiers who have achieved mightier victories in
the field, and made conquests more nearly corresponding to the
boundlessness of selfish ambition; statesmen who have been
connected with more startling upheavals of society: but it is the
greatness of Washington that in public trusts he used power solely
for the public good; that he was the life and moderator and stay of
the most momentous revolution in human affairs; its moving impulse
and its restraining power....</p>
<p>This also is the praise of Washington: that never in the tide of
time has any man lived who had in so great a degree the almost
divine faculty to command the confidence of his fellow-men and rule
the willing. Wherever he became known, in his family, his
neighborhood, his county, his native State, the continent, the
camp, civil life, among the common people, in foreign courts,
throughout the civilized world, and even among the savages, he,
beyond all other men, had the confidence of his kind.</p>

<h2>JOHN AND MICHAEL BANIM</h2>

<p>f the writers who have won esteem by telling the pathetic
stories of their country's people, the names of John and Michael
Banim are ranked among the Irish Gael not lower than that of Sir
Walter Scott among the British Gael. The works of the Banim
brothers continued the same sad and fascinating story of the "mere
Irish" which Maria Edgeworth and Lady Morgan had laid to the hearts
of English readers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
century days. The Banim family was one of those which belonged to
the class of "middlemen," people so designated in Ireland who were
neither rich nor poor, but in the fortunate mean. The family home
was in the historic town of Kilkenny, famous alike for its fighting
confederation and its fighting cats. Here Michael was born August
5th, 1796, and John April 3d, 1798. Michael lived to a green old
age, and survived his younger brother John twenty-eight years, less
seventeen days; he died at Booterstown, August 30th, 1874.</p>

<b>John Banim.</b></p>
<p>The first stories of this brotherly collaboration in letters
appeared in 1825 without mark of authorship, as recitals
contributed for instruction and amusement about the hearth-stone of
an Irish household, called 'The O'Hara Family.' The minor chords of
the soft music of the Gaelic English as it fell from the tongues of
Irish lads and lasses, whether in note of sorrow or of sport, had
already begun to touch with winsome tenderness the stolid Saxon
hearts, when that idyl of their country's penal days, 'The Bit o'
Writin',' was sent out from the O'Hara fireside. The almost
instantaneous success and popularity of their first stories
speedily broke down the anonymity of the Banims, and publishers
became eager and gain-giving. About two dozen stories were
published before the death of John, in 1842. The best-known of
them, in addition to the one already mentioned, are 'The Boyne
Water,' 'The Croppy,' and 'Father Connell.'</p>
<p>The fact that during the long survival of Michael no more of the
Banim stories appeared, is sometimes called in as evidence that the
latter had little to do with the writing of the series. Michael and
John, it was well known, had worked lovingly together, and Michael
claimed a part in thirteen of the tales, without excluding his
brother from joint authorship. Exactly what each wrote of the joint
productions has never been known. A single dramatic work of the
Banim brothers has attained to a position in the standard drama,
the play of 'Damon and Pythias,' a free adaptation from an Italian
original, written by John Banim at the instance of Richard Lalor
Shiel. The songs are also attributed to John. It is but just to say
that the great emigration to the United States which absorbed the
Irish during the '40's and '50's depreciated the sale of such works
as those of the Banims to the lowest point, and Michael had good
reason, aside from the loss of his brother's aid, to lay down his
pen. The audience of the Irish story-teller had gone away across
the great western sea. There was nothing to do but sit by the
lonesome hearth and await one's own to-morrow for the voyage of the
greater sea.</p>

<center><b>THE PUBLICAN'S DREAM</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'The Bit o' Writin' and Other Tales'</center>
<br>
<p>The fair-day had passed over in a little straggling town in the
southeast of Ireland, and was succeeded by a languor proportioned
to the wild excitement it never failed to create. But of all in the
village, its publicans suffered most under the reaction of great
bustle. Few of their houses appeared open at broad noon; and
some--the envy of their competitors--continued closed even after
that late hour. Of these latter, many were of the very humblest
kind; little cabins, in fact, skirting the outlets of the village,
or standing alone on the roadside a good distance beyond it.</p>
<p>About two o'clock upon the day in question, a house of
"Entertainment for Man and Horse," the very last of the description
noticed to be found between the village and the wild tract of
mountain country adjacent to it, was opened by the proprietress,
who had that moment arisen from bed.</p>
<p>The cabin consisted of only two apartments, and scarce more than
nominally even of two; for the half-plastered wicker and straw
partition, which professed to cut off a sleeping-nook from the
whole area inclosed by the clay walls, was little higher than a
tall man, and moreover chinky and porous in many places. Let the
assumed distinction be here allowed to stand, however, while the
reader casts his eyes around what was sometimes called the kitchen,
sometimes the tap-room, sometimes the "dancing-flure." Forms which
had run by the walls, and planks by way of tables which had been
propped before them, were turned topsy-turvy, and in some instances
broken. Pewter pots and pints, battered and bruised, or squeezed
together and flattened, and fragments of twisted glass tumblers,
lay beside them. The clay floor was scraped with brogue-nails and
indented with the heel of that primitive foot-gear, in token of the
energetic dancing which had lately been performed upon it. In a
corner still appeared (capsized, however) an empty eight-gallon
beer barrel, recently the piper's throne, whence his bag had blown
forth the inspiring storms of jigs and reels, which prompted to
more antics than ever did a bag of the laughing-gas. Among the
yellow turf-ashes of the hearth lay on its side an old blackened
tin kettle, without a spout,--a principal utensil in brewing
scalding water for the manufacture of whisky-punch; and its soft
and yet warm bed was shared by a red cat, who had stolen in from
his own orgies, through some cranny, since day-break. The single
four-paned window of the apartment remained veiled by its rough
shutter, that turned on leather hinges; but down the wide yawning
chimney came sufficient light to reveal the objects here
described.</p>
<p>The proprietress opened her back door. She was a woman of about
forty; of a robust, large-boned figure; with broad, rosy visage,
dark, handsome eyes, and well-cut nose: but inheriting a mouth so
wide as to proclaim her pure aboriginal Irish pedigree. After a
look abroad, to inhale the fresh air, and then a remonstrance
(ending in a kick) with the hungry pig, who ran, squeaking and
grunting, to demand his long-deferred breakfast, she settled her
cap, rubbed down her <i>prauskeen</i> [coarse apron], tucked and
pinned up her skirts behind, and saying in a loud, commanding
voice, as she spoke into the sleeping-chamber, "Get up now at once,
Jer, I bid you," vigorously if not tidily set about putting her
tavern to rights.</p>
<p>During her bustle the dame would stop an instant, and bend her
ear to listen for a stir inside the partition; but at last losing
patience she resumed:--</p>
<p>"Why, then, my heavy hatred on you, Jer Mulcahy, is it gone into
a <i>sauvaun</i> [pleasant drowsiness] you are, over again? or
maybe you stole out of bed, an' put your hand on one o' them ould
good-for-nothing books, that makes you the laziest man that a poor
woman ever had tinder one roof wid her? ay, an' that sent you out
of our dacent shop an' house, in the heart of the town below, an'
banished us here, Jer Mulcahy, to sell drams o' whisky an' pots o'
beer to all the riff-raff o' the counthry-side, instead o' the nate
boots an' shoes you served your honest time to?"</p>
<p>She entered his, or her chamber, rather, hoping that she might
detect him luxuriantly perusing in bed one of the mutilated books,
a love of which (or more truly a love of indolence, thus
manifesting itself) had indeed chiefly caused his downfall in the
world. Her husband, however, really tired after his unusual bodily
efforts of the previous day, only slumbered, as Mrs. Mulcahy had at
first anticipated; and when she had shaken and aroused him, for the
twentieth time that morning, and scolded him until the
spirit-broken blockhead whimpered,--nay, wept, or pretended to
weep,--the dame returned to her household duties.</p>
<p>She did not neglect, however, to keep calling to him every
half-minute, until at last Mr. Jeremiah Mulcahy strode into the
kitchen: a tall, ill-contrived figure, that had once been well
fitted out, but that now wore its old skin, like its old clothes,
very loosely; and those old clothes were a discolored, threadbare,
half-polished kerseymere pair of trousers, and aged superfine black
coat, the last relics of his former Sunday finery,--to which had
recently and incongruously been added a calfskin vest, a pair of
coarse sky-blue peasant's stockings, and a pair of brogues. His
hanging cheeks and lips told, together, his present bad living and
domestic subjection; and an eye that had been blinded by the
smallpox wore neither patch nor band, although in better days it
used to be genteelly hidden from remark,--an assumption of
consequence now deemed incompatible with his altered condition in
society.</p>
<p>"O Cauth! oh, I had such a dhrame," he said, as he made his
appearance.</p>
<p>"An' I'll go bail you had," answered Cauth, "an' when do you
ever go asleep without having one dhrame or another, that pesters
me off o' my legs the livelong day, till the night falls again to
let you have another? Musha, Jer, don't be ever an' always such a
fool; an' never mind the dhrame now, but lend a hand to help me in
the work o' the house. See the pewther there: haive it up, man
alive, an' take it out into the garden, and sit on the big stone in
the sun, an' make it look as well as you can, afther the ill usage
it got last night; come, hurry, Jer--go an' do what I bid you."</p>
<p>He retired in silence to "the garden," a little patch of ground
luxuriant in potatoes and a few cabbages. Mrs. Mulcahy pursued her
work till her own sensations warned her that it was time to prepare
her husband's morning or rather day meal; for by the height of the
sun it should now be many hours past noon. So she put down her pot
of potatoes; and when they were boiled, took out a wooden trencher
full of them, and a mug of sour milk, to Jer, determined not to
summon him from his useful occupation of restoring the pints and
quarts to something of their former shape.</p>
<p>Stepping through the back door, and getting him in view, she
stopped short in silent anger. His back was turned to her, because
of the sun; and while the vessels, huddled about in confusion,
seemed little the better of his latent skill and industry, there he
sat on his favorite round stone, studiously perusing, half aloud to
himself, some idle volume which doubtless he had smuggled into the
garden in his pocket. Laying down her trencher and her mug, Mrs.
Mulcahy stole forward on tiptoe, gained his shoulder without being
heard, snatched the imperfect bundle of soiled pages out of his
hand, and hurled it into a neighbor's cabbage-bed.</p>
<p>Jeremiah complained, in his usual half-crying tone, declaring
that "she never could let him alone, so she couldn't, and he would
rather list for a soger than lade such a life, from year's end to
year's end, so he would."</p>
<p>"Well, an' do then--an' whistle that idle cur off wid you,"
pointing to a nondescript puppy, which had lain happily coiled up
at his master's feet until Mrs. Mulcahy's appearance, but that now
watched her closely, his ears half cocked and his eyes wide open,
though his position remained unaltered. "Go along to the divil, you
lazy whelp you!"--she took up a pint in which a few drops of beer
remained since the previous night, and drained it on the puppy's
head, who instantly ran off, jumping sideways, and yelping as loud
as if some bodily injury had really visited him--"Yes, an' now you
begin to yowl, like your masther, for nothing at all, only because
a body axes you to stir your idle legs--hould your tongue, you
foolish baste!" she stooped for a stone--"one would think I scalded
you."</p>
<p>"You know you did, once, Cauth, to the backbone; an' small blame
for Shuffle to be afeard o' you ever since," said Jer.</p>
<p>This vindication of his own occasional remonstrances, as well as
of Shuffle's, was founded in truth. When very young, just to keep
him from running against her legs while she was busy over the fire,
Mrs. Mulcahy certainly had emptied a ladleful of boiling
potato-water upon the poor puppy's back; and from that moment it
was only necessary to spill a drop of the coldest possible water,
or of any cold liquid, on any part of his body, and he believed he
was again dreadfully scalded, and ran out of the house screaming in
all the fancied theories of torture.</p>
<p>"Will you ate your good dinner, now, Jer Mulcahy, an' promise to
do something to help me, afther it?--Mother o' Saints!"--thus she
interrupted herself, turning towards the place where she had
deposited the eulogized food--"see that yon unlucky bird! May I
never do an ill turn but there's the pig afther spilling the sweet
milk, an' now shoveling the beautiful white-eyes down her throat at
a mouthful!"</p>
<p>Jer, really afflicted at this scene, promised to work hard the
moment he got his dinner; and his spouse, first procuring a
pitchfork to beat the pig into her sty, prepared a fresh meal for
him, and retired to eat her own in the house, and then to continue
her labor.</p>
<p>In about an hour she thought of paying him another visit of
inspection, when Jeremiah's voice reached her ear, calling out in
disturbed accents, "Cauth! Cauth! <i>a-vourneen!</i> For the love
o' heaven, Cauth! where are you?"</p>
<p>Running to him, she found her husband sitting upright, though
not upon his round stone, amongst the still untouched heap of pots
and pints, his pock-marked face very pale, his single eye staring,
his hands clasped and shaking, and moisture on his forehead.</p>
<p>"What!" she cried, "the pewther just as I left it, over
again!"</p>
<p>"O Cauth! Cauth! don't mind that now--but spake to me kind,
Cauth, an' comfort me."</p>
<p>"Why, what ails you, Jer <i>a-vous neen</i>?" affectionately
taking his hand, when she saw how really agitated he was.</p>
<p>"O Cauth, oh, I had such a dhrame, now, in earnest, at any
rate!"</p>
<p>"A dhrame!" she repeated, letting go his hand, "a dhrame, Jer
Mulcahy! so, afther your good dinner, you go for to fall asleep,
Jer Mulcahy, just to be ready wid a new dhrame for me, instead of
the work you came out here to do, five blessed hours ago!"</p>
<p>"Don't scould me, now, Cauth; don't, a-pet: only listen to me,
an' then say what you like. You know the lonesome little glen
between the hills, on the short cut for man or horse, to
Kilbroggan? Well, Cauth, there I found myself in the dhrame; and I
saw two sailors, tired afther a day's hard walking, sitting before
one of the big rocks that stand upright in the wild place; an' they
were ating or dhrinking, I couldn't make out which; and one was a
tall, sthrong, broad-shouldhered man, an' the other was sthrong,
too, but short an' burly; an' while they were talking very civilly
to each other, lo an' behould you, Cauth, I seen the tall man whip
his knife into the little man; an' then they both sthruggled, an'
wrastled, an' schreeched together, till the rocks rung again; but
at last the little man was a corpse; an' may I never see a sight o'
glory, Cauth, but all this was afore me as plain as you are, in
this garden! an' since the hour I was born, Cauth, I never got such
a fright; an'--oh, Cauth! what's that now?"</p>
<p>"What is it, you poor fool, you, but a customer, come at last
into the kitchen--an' time for us to see the face o' one this
blessed day. Get up out o' that, wid your dhrames--don't you hear
'em knocking? I'll stay here to put one vessel at laste to
rights--for I see I must."</p>
<p>Jeremiah arose, groaning, and entered the cabin through the back
door. In a few seconds he hastened to his wife, more
terror-stricken than he had left her, and settling his loins
against the low garden wall, stared at her.</p>
<p>"Why, then, duoul's in you, Jer Mulcahy (saints forgive me for
cursing!)--and what's the matter wid you, at-all at-all?"</p>
<p>"They're in the kitchen," he whispered.</p>
<p>"Well, an' what will they take?"</p>
<p>"I spoke never a word to them, Cauth, nor they to me;--I
couldn't--an' I won't, for a duke's ransom: I only saw them
stannin' together, in the dark that's coming on, behind the dour,
an' I knew them at the first look--the tall one an' the little
one."</p>
<p>With a flout at his dreams, and his cowardice, and his
good-for-nothingness, the dame hurried to serve her customers.
Jeremiah heard her loud voice addressing them, and their hoarse
tones answering. She came out again for two pints to draw some
beer, and commanded him to follow her and "discoorse the
customers." He remained motionless. She returned in a short time,
and fairly drove him before her into the house.</p>
<p>He took a seat remote from his guests, with difficulty
pronouncing the ordinary words of "God save ye, genteels," which
they bluffly and heartily answered. His glances towards them were
also few; yet enough to inform him that they conversed together
like friends, pledging healths and shaking hands. The tall sailor
abruptly asked him how far it was, by the short cut, to a village
where they proposed to pass the night--Kilbroggan?--Jeremiah
started on his seat, and his wife, after a glance and a grumble at
him, was obliged to speak for her husband. They finished their
beer; paid for it; put up half a loaf and a cut of bad watery
cheese, saying that they might feel more hungry a few miles on than
they now did; and then they arose to leave the cabin. Jeremiah
glanced in great trouble around. His wife had fortunately
disappeared; he snatched up his old hat, and with more energy than
he could himself remember, ran forward to be a short way on the
road before them. They soon approached him; and then, obeying a
conscientious impulse, Jeremiah saluted the smaller of the two, and
requested to speak with him apart. The sailor, in evident surprise,
assented. Jer vaguely cautioned him against going any farther that
night, as it would be quite dark by the time he should get to the
mountain pass, on the by-road to Kilbroggan. His warning was made
light of. He grew more earnest, asserting, what was not the fact,
that it was "a bad road," meaning one infested by robbers. Still
the bluff tar paid no attention, and was turning away. "Oh, sir;
oh, stop, sir," resumed Jeremiah, taking great courage, "I have a
thing to tell you;" and he rehearsed his dream, averring that in it
he had distinctly seen the present object of his solicitude set
upon and slain by his colossal companion. The listener paused a
moment; first looking at Jer, and then at the ground, very gravely:
but the next moment he burst into a loud, and Jeremiah thought,
frightful laugh, and walked rapidly to overtake his shipmate.
Jeremiah, much oppressed, returned home.</p>
<p>Towards dawn, next morning, the publican awoke in an ominous
panic, and aroused his wife to listen to a loud knocking, and a
clamor of voices at their door. She insisted that there was no such
thing, and scolded him for disturbing her sleep. A renewal of the
noise, however, convinced even her incredulity, and showed that
Jeremiah was right for the first time in his life, at least. Both
arose, and hastened to answer the summons.</p>
<p>When they unbarred the front door, a gentleman, surrounded by a
crowd of people of the village, stood before it. He had discovered
on the by-road through the hills from Kilbroggan, a dead body,
weltering in its gore, and wearing sailor's clothes; had ridden on
in alarm; had raised the village; and some of its population,
recollecting to have seen Mrs. Mulcahy's visitors of the previous
evening, now brought him to her house to hear what she could say on
the subject.</p>
<p>Before she could say anything, her husband fell senseless at her
side, groaning dolefully. While the bystanders raised him, she
clapped her hands, and exalted her voice in ejaculations, as
Irishwomen, when grieved or astonished or vexed, usually do; and
now, as proud of Jeremiah's dreaming capabilities as she had before
been impatient of them, rehearsed his vision of the murder, and
authenticated the visit of the two sailors to her house, almost
while he was in the act of making her the confidant of his
prophetic ravings. The auditors stept back in consternation,
crossing themselves, smiting their breasts, and crying out, "The
Lord save us! The Lord have mercy upon us!"</p>
<p>Jeremiah slowly awoke from his swoon. The gentleman who had
discovered the body commanded his attendants back to the lonesome
glen, where it lay. Poor Jeremiah fell on his knees, and with tears
streaming down his cheeks, prayed to be saved from such a trial.
His neighbors almost forced him along.</p>
<p>All soon gained the spot, a narrow pass between slanting piles
of displaced rocks; the hills from which they had tumbled rising
brown and barren and to a great height above and beyond them. And
there, indeed, upon the strip of verdure which formed the winding
road through the defile, lay the corpse of one of the sailors who
had visited the publican's house the evening before.</p>
<p>Again Jeremiah dropt on his knees, at some distance from the
body, exclaiming, "Lord save us!--yes! oh, yes, neighbors, this is
the very place!--only--the saints be good to us again!--'twas the
tall sailor I seen killing the little sailor, and here's the tall
sailor murthered by the little sailor."</p>
<p>"Dhrames go by conthraries, some way or another," observed one
of his neighbors; and Jeremiah's puzzle was resolved.</p>
<p>Two steps were now indispensable to be taken; the county coroner
should be summoned, and the murderer sought after. The crowd parted
to engage in both matters simultaneously. Evening drew on when they
again met in the pass: and the first, who had gone for the coroner,
returned with him, a distance of near twenty miles; but the second
party did not prove so successful. In fact they had discovered no
clue to the present retreat of the supposed assassin.</p>
<p>The coroner impaneled his jury, and held his inquest under a
large upright rock, bedded in the middle of the pass, such as
Jeremiah said he had seen in his dream. A verdict of willful murder
against the absent sailor was quickly agreed upon; but ere it could
be recorded, all hesitated, not knowing how to individualize a man
of whose name they were ignorant.</p>
<p>The summer night had fallen upon their deliberations, and the
moon arose in splendor, shining over the top of one of the high
hills that inclosed the pass, so as fully to illumine the bosom of
the other. During their pause, a man appeared standing upon the
line of the hill thus favored by the moonlight, and every eye
turned in that direction. He ran down the abrupt declivity beneath
him; he gained the continued sweep of jumbled rocks which
immediately walled in the little valley, springing from one to
another of them with such agility and certainty that it seemed
almost magical; and a general whisper of fear now attested the fact
of his being dressed in a straw hat, a short jacket, and loose
white trousers. As he jumped from the last rock upon the sward of
the pass, the spectators drew back; but he, not seeming to notice
them, walked up to the corpse, which had not yet been touched; took
its hand; turned up its face into the moonlight, and attentively
regarded the features; let the hand go; pushed his hat upon his
forehead; glanced around him; recognized the person in authority;
approached, and stood still before him, and said "Here I am, Tom
Mills, that killed long Harry Holmes, and there he lies."</p>
<p>The coroner cried out to secure him, now fearing that the man's
sturdiness meant farther harm. "No need," resumed the self-accused;
"here's my bread-and-cheese knife, the only weapon about me;" he
threw it on the ground: "I come back just to ax you, commodore, to
order me a cruise after poor Harry, bless his precious eyes,
wherever he is bound."</p>
<p>"You have been pursued hither?"</p>
<p>"No, bless your heart; but I wouldn't pass such another watch as
the last twenty-four hours for all the prize-money won at
Trafalgar. 'Tisn't in regard of not tasting food or wetting my lips
ever since I fell foul of Harry, or of hiding my head like a cursed
animal o' the yearth, and starting if a bird only hopped nigh me:
but I cannot go on living on this tack no longer; that's it; and
the least I can say to you, Harry, my hearty."</p>
<p>"What caused your quarrel with your comrade?"</p>
<p>"There was no jar or jabber betwixt us, d'you see me."</p>
<p>"Not at the time, I understand you to mean; but surely you must
have long owed him a grudge?"</p>
<p>"No, but long loved him; and he me."</p>
<p>"Then, in heaven's name, what put the dreadful thought in your
head?"</p>
<p>"The devil, commodore, (the horned lubber!) and another lubber
to help him"--pointing at Jeremiah, who shrank to the skirts of the
crowd. "I'll tell you every word of it, commodore, as true as a
log-book. For twenty long and merry years, Harry and I sailed
together, and worked together, thro' a hard gale sometimes, and
thro' hot sun another time; and never a squally word came between
us till last night, and then it all came of that lubberly
swipes-seller, I say again. I thought as how it was a real awful
thing that a strange landsman, before ever he laid eyes on either
of us, should come to have this here dream about us. After falling
in with Harry, when the lubber and I parted company, my old mate
saw I was cast down, and he told me as much in his own gruff,
well-meaning way; upon which I gave him the story, laughing at it.
<i>He</i> didn't laugh in return, but grew glum--glummer than I
ever seed him; and I wondered, and fell to boxing about my
thoughts, more and more (deep sea sink that cursed thinking and
thinking, say I!--it sends many an honest fellow out of his
course); and 'It's hard to know the best man's mind,' I thought to
myself. Well, we came on the tack into these rocky parts, and Harry
says to me all on a sudden, 'Tom, try the soundings here, ahead, by
yourself--or let me, by myself.' I axed him why? 'No matter,' says
Harry again, 'but after what you chawed about, I don't like your
company any farther, till we fall in again at the next village.'
'What, Harry,' I cries, laughing heartier than ever, 'are you
afeard of your own mind with Tom Mills?' 'Pho,' he made answer,
walking on before me, and I followed him.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' I kept saying to myself, 'he <i>is</i> afeard of his own
mind with his old shipmate.' 'Twas a darker night than this, and
when I looked ahead, the devil (for I know 'twas <i>he</i> that
boarded me!) made me take notice what a good spot it was for Harry
to fall foul of me. And then I watched him making way before me, in
the dark, and couldn't help thinking he was the better man of the
two--a head and shoulders over me, and a match for any two of my
inches. And then again, I brought to mind that Harry would be a
heavy purse the better of sending me to Davy's locker, seeing we
had both been just paid off, and got a lot of prize-money to
boot;--and at last (the real red devil having fairly got me helm
a-larboard) I argufied with myself that Tom Mills would be as well
alive, with Harry Holmes's luck in his pocket, as he could be dead,
and <i>his</i> in Harry Holmes's; not to say nothing of taking
one's own part, just to keep one's self afloat, if so be Harry let
his mind run as mine was running.</p>
<p>"All this time Harry never gave me no hail, but kept tacking
through these cursed rocks; and that, and his last words, made me
doubt him more and more. At last he stopped nigh where he now lies,
and sitting with his back to that high stone, he calls for my blade
to cut the bread and cheese he had got at the village; and while he
spoke I believed he looked glummer and glummer, and that he wanted
the blade, the only one between us, for some'at else than to cut
bread and cheese; though now I don't believe no such thing
howsumdever; but then I did: and so, d'you see me, commodore, I
lost ballast all of a sudden, and when he stretched out his hand
for the blade (hell's fire blazing up in my lubberly heart!)--'Here
it is, Harry,' says I, and I gives it to him in the side!--once,
twice, in the right place!" (the sailor's voice, hitherto calm,
though broken and rugged, now rose into a high, wild cadence)--"and
then how we did grapple! and sing out one to another! ahoy! yeho!
aye; till I thought the whole crew of devils answered our hail from
the hill-tops!--But I hit you again and again, Harry! before you
could master me," continued the sailor, returning to the corpse,
and once more taking its hand--"until at last you struck,--my old
messmate!--And now--nothing remains for Tom Mills--but to man the
yard-arm!"</p>
<p>The narrator stood his trial at the ensuing assizes, and was
executed for this avowed murder of his shipmate; Jeremiah appearing
as a principal witness. Our story may seem drawn either from
imagination, or from mere village gossip: its chief acts rest,
however, upon the authority of members of the Irish bar, since
risen to high professional eminence; and they can even vouch that
at least Jeremiah asserted the truth of "The Publican's Dream."</p>

<h2>TH&Eacute;ODORE DE BANVILLE</h2>
<h3>(1823-1891)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>h&eacute;odore Faullain De Banville is best known as a very
skillful maker of polished artificial verse. His poetry stands
high; but it is the poetry not of nature, but of elegant society.
His muse, as Mr. Henley says, is always in evening dress.
References to the classic poets are woven into all of his
descriptions of nature. He is distinguished, scholarly, full of
taste, and brilliant in execution; never failing in propriety, and
never reaching inspiration. As an artist in words and cadences he
has few superiors.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-040.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>De Banville.</b></p>
<p>These qualities are partly acquired, and partly the result of
birth. Born in 1823, the son of a naval officer, from his earliest
years he devoted himself to literature. His birthplace, Moulins, an
old provincial town on the banks of the Allier, where he spent a
happy childhood, made little impression on him. Still almost a
child he went to Paris, where he led a life without
events,--without even a marriage or an election to the Academy; he
died March 13th, 1891. His place was among the society people and
the artists; the painter Courbet and the writers M&uuml;rger,
Baudelaire, and Gautier were among his closest friends. He first
attracted attention in 1848 by the publication of a volume of
verse, 'The Caryatids.' In 1857 came another, 'Odes Funambulesque,'
and later another series under the same title, the two together
containing his best work in verse. Here he stands highest; though
he wrote also many plays, one of which, 'Gringoire,' has been acted
in various translations. 'The Wife of Socrates' also holds the
stage. Like his other work, his drama is artificial, refined, and
skillful. He presents a marked instance of the artist working for
art's sake. During the latter years of his life he wrote mostly
prose, and he has left many well-drawn portraits of his
contemporaries, in addition to several books of criticism, with
much color and charm, but little definiteness. He was always vague,
for facts did not interest him; but he had the power of making his
remote, unreal world attractive, and among the writers of the
school of Gautier he stands among the first.</p>

<center><b>LE CAF&Eacute;</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'The Soul of Paris'</center>
<br>
<p>Imagine a place where you do not endure the horror of being
alone, and yet have the freedom of solitude. There, free from the
dust, the boredom, the vulgarities of a household, you reflect at
ease, comfortably seated before a table, unincumbered by all the
things that oppress you in houses; for if useless objects and
papers had accumulated here they would have been promptly removed.
You smoke slowly, quietly, like a Turk, following your thoughts
among the blue curves.</p>
<p>If you have a voluptuous desire to taste some warm or refreshing
beverage, well-trained waiters bring it to you immediately. If you
feel like talking with clever men who will not bully you, you have
within reach light sheets on which are printed winged thoughts,
rapid, written for you, which you are not forced to bind and
preserve in a library when they have ceased to please you. This
place, the paradise of civilization, the last and inviolable refuge
of the free man, is the caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>It is the caf&eacute;; but in the ideal, as we dream it, as it
ought to be. The lack of room and the fabulous cost of land on the
boulevards of Paris make it hideous in actuality. In these little
boxes--of which the rent is that of a palace--one would be foolish
to look for the space of a vestiary. Besides, the walls are
decorated with stovepipe hats and overcoats hung on
clothes-pegs--an abominable sight, for which atonement is offered
by multitudes of white panels and ignoble gilding, imitations made
by economical process.</p>
<p>And (let us not deceive ourselves) the overcoat, with which one
never knows what to do, and which makes us worry everywhere,--in
society, at the theatre, at balls,--is the great enemy and the
abominable enslavement of modern life. Happy the gentlemen of the
age of Louis XIV., who in the morning dressed themselves for all
day, in satin and velvet, their brows protected by wigs, and who
remained superb even when beaten by the storm, and who, moreover,
brave as lions, ran the risk of pneumonia even if they had to put
on, one outside the other, the innumerable waistcoats of Jodelet in
'Les Pr&eacute;cieuses Ridicules'!</p>
<p>"How shall I find my overcoat and my wife's party cape?" is the
great and only cry, the Hamlet-monologue of the modern man, that
poisons every minute of his life and makes him look with
resignation toward his dying hour. On the morning after a ball
given by Marshal MacMahon nothing is found: the overcoats have
disappeared; the satin cloaks, the boas, the lace scarfs have gone
up in smoke; and the women must rush in despair through the driving
snow while their husbands try to button their evening coats, which
will not button!</p>
<p>One evening, at a party given by the wife of the President of
the Chamber of Deputies, at which the gardens were lighted by
electricity, Gambetta suddenly wished to show some of his guests a
curiosity, and invited them to go down with him into the bushes. A
valet hastened to hand him his overcoat, but the guests did not
dare to ask for theirs, and followed Gambetta as they were!
However, I believe one or two of them survived.</p>
<p>At the caf&eacute; no one carries off your overcoat, no one
hides it; but they are all hung up, spread out on the wall like
masterpieces of art, treated as if they were portraits of Mona Lisa
or Violante, and you have them before your eyes, you see them
continually. Is there not reason to curse the moment your eyes
first saw the light? One may, as I have said, read the papers; or
rather one might read them if they were not hung on those
abominable racks, which remove them a mile from you and force you
to see them on your horizon.</p>
<p>As to the drinks, give up all hope; for the owner of the
caf&eacute; has no proper place for their preparation, and his rent
is so enormous that he has to make the best even of the quality he
sells. But aside from this reason, the drinks could not be good,
because there are too many of them. The last thing one finds at
these coffee-houses is coffee. It is delicious, divine, in those
little Oriental shops where it is made to order for each drinker in
a special little pot. As to syrups, how many are there in Paris? In
what inconceivable place can they keep the jars containing the
fruit juices needed to make them? A few real ladies, rich,
well-born, good housekeepers, not reduced to slavery by the great
shops, who do not rouge or paint their cheeks, still know how to
make in their own homes good syrups from the fruit of their gardens
and their vineyards. But they naturally do not give them away or
sell them to the keepers of caf&eacute;s, but keep them to gladden
their flaxen-haired children.</p>
<p>Such as it is,--with its failings and its vices, even a full
century after the fame of Procope,--the caf&eacute;, which we
cannot drive out of our memories, has been the asylum and the
refuge of many charming spirits. The old Tabourey, who, after
having been illustrious, now has a sort of half popularity and a
pewter bar, formerly heard the captivating conversations of Barbey
and of Aurevilly, who were rivals in the noblest salons, and who
sometimes preferred to converse seated before a marble table in a
hall from which one could see the foliage and the flowers of the
Luxembourg. Baudelaire also talked there, with his clear caressing
voice dropping diamonds and precious stones, like the princess of
the fairy tale, from beautiful red, somewhat thick lips.</p>
<p>A problem with no possible solution holds in check the writers
and the artists of Paris. When one has worked hard all day it is
pleasant to take a seat, during the short stroll that precedes the
dinner, to meet one's comrades and talk with them of everything but
politics. The only favorable place for these necessary accidental
meetings is the caf&eacute;; but is the game worth the candle, or,
to speak more exactly, the blinding gas-jets? Is it worth while,
for the pleasure of exchanging words, to accept criminal absinthe,
unnatural bitters, tragic vermouth, concocted in the sombre
laboratories of the caf&eacute;s by frightful parasites?</p>
<p>Aur&eacute;lien Scholl, who, being a fine poet and excellent
writer, is naturally a practical man, had a pleasing idea. He
wished that the reunions in the caf&eacute;s might continue at the
absinthe hour, but without the absinthe! A very honest man, chosen
for that purpose, would pour out for the passers-by, in place of
everything else, excellent claret with quinquina, which would have
the double advantage of not poisoning them and of giving them a
wholesome and comforting drink. But this seductive dream could
never be realized. Of course, honest men exist in great numbers,
among keepers of caf&eacute;s as well as in other walks of life;
but the individual honest man could not be found who would be
willing to pour out quinquina wine in which there was both
quinquina and wine.</p>
<p>In the Palais Royal there used to be a caf&eacute; which had
retained Empire fittings and oil lamps. One found there real wine,
real coffee, real milk, and good beefsteaks. Roqueplan,
Ars&egrave;ne Houssaye, Michel L&eacute;vy, and the handsome
Fiorentino used to breakfast there, and they knew how to get the
best mushrooms. The proprietor of the caf&eacute; had said that as
soon as he could no longer make a living by selling genuine
articles, he would not give up his stock in trade to another, but
would sell his furniture and shut up shop. He kept his word. He was
a hero.</p>

<h2>ANNA L&AElig;TITIA BARBAULD</h2>
<h3>(1743-1825)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-W.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>hen L&aelig;titia Aikin Barbauld was about thirty years old, her
friend, Mrs. Elizabeth Montague, wishing to establish a college for
women, asked her to be its principal. In her letter of refusal Mrs.
Barbauld said:--"A kind of Academy for ladies, where they are to be
taught in a regular manner the various branches of science, appears
to me better calculated to form such characters as the
<i>Pr&eacute;cieuses</i> or <i>Femmes Savantes</i> than good wives
or agreeable companions. The very best way for a woman to acquire
knowledge is from conversation with a father or brother.... The
thefts of knowledge in our sex are only connived at while carefully
concealed, and if displayed are punished with disgrace." It is odd
to find Mrs. Barbauld thus reflecting the old-fashioned view of the
capacity and requirements of her own sex, for she herself belonged
to that brilliant group--Hannah More, Fanny Burney, Maria
Edgeworth, Jane Austen, Joanna Baillie, Mary Russell Mitford--who
were the living refutation of her inherited theories. Their
influence shows a pedagogic impulse to present morally helpful
ideas to the public.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-047.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Anna L. Barbauld.</b></p>
<p>From preceding generations whose lives had been concentrated
upon household affairs, these women pioneers had acquired the
strictly practical bent of mind which comes out in all their verse,
as in all their prose.</p>
<p>The child born at Kibworth Harcourt, Leicestershire, a century
and a half ago, became one of the first of these pleasant writers
for young and old. She was one of the thousand refutations of the
stupid popular idea that precocious children never amount to
anything. When only two, she "could read roundly without spelling,
and in half a year more could read as well as most women." Her
father was master of a boys' school, where her childhood was passed
under the rule of a loving but austere mother, who disliked all
intercourse with the pupils for her daughter. It was not the
fashion for women to be highly educated; but, stimulated perhaps by
the scholastic atmosphere, L&aelig;titia implored her father for a
classical training, until, against his judgment, he allowed her to
study Greek and Latin as well as French and Italian. Though not
fond of the housewifely accomplishments insisted upon by Mrs.
Aikin, the eager student also cooked and sewed with due
obedience.</p>
<p>Her dull childhood ended when she was fifteen, for then her
father accepted a position as classical tutor in a boys' school at
Warrington, Lancashire, to which place the family moved. The new
home afforded greater freedom and an interesting circle of friends,
among them Currie, William Roscoe, John Taylor, and the famous Dr.
Priestley. A very pretty girl, with brilliant blonde coloring and
animated dark-blue eyes, she was witty and vivacious, too, under
the modest diffidence to which she had been trained. Naturally she
attracted much admiration from the schoolboys and even from their
elders, but on the whole she seems to have found study and writing
more interesting than love affairs. The first suitor, who presented
himself when she was about sixteen, was a farmer from her early
home at Kibworth. He stated his wishes to her father. "She is in
the garden," said Mr. Aikin. "You may ask her yourself."
L&aelig;titia was not propitious, but the young man was persistent,
and the position grew irksome. So the nimble girl scrambled into a
convenient tree, and escaped her rustic wooer by swinging herself
down upon the other side of the garden wall.</p>
<p>During these years at Warrington she wrote for her own pleasure,
and when her brother John returned home after several years'
absence, he helped her to arrange and publish a selection of her
poems. The little book which appeared in 1773 was highly praised,
and ran through four editions within a year. In spite of grace and
fluency, most of these verses seem flat and antiquated to the
modern reader. Of the spirited first poem 'Corsica,' Dr. Priestley
wrote to her:--"I consider that you are as much a general as
Tyrt&aelig;us was, and your poems (which I am confident are much
better than his ever were) may have as great effect as his. They
may be the <i>coup de grace</i> to the French troops in that
island, and Paoli, who reads English, will cause it to be printed
in every history in that renowned island."</p>
<p>Miss Aikin's next venture was a small volume in collaboration
with her brother, 'Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose by J. and A.L.
Aikin.' This too was widely read and admired. Samuel Rogers has
related an amusing conversation about the book in its first
vogue:--"I am greatly pleased with your 'Miscellaneous Pieces,'"
said Charles James Fox to Mrs. Barbauld's brother. Dr. Aikin bowed.
"I particularly admire," continued Fox, "your essay 'Against
Inconsistency in our Expectations.'" "That," replied Aikin, "is my
sister's." "I like much," continued Fox, "your essay on 'Monastic
Institutions.'" "That," answered Aikin, "is also my sister's." Fox
thought it wise to say no more about the book. The essay 'Against
Inconsistency in our Expectations' was most highly praised by the
critics, and pronounced by Mackintosh "the best short essay in the
language."</p>
<p>When thirty years old, L&aelig;titia Aikin married Rochemont
Barbauld, and went to live at Palgrave in Suffolk, where her
husband opened a boys' school, soon made popular by her personal
charm and influence. Sir William Gell, a classic topographer still
remembered; William Taylor, author of a 'Historic Survey of German
Poetry'; and Lord Chief Justice Denman, were a few among the many
who looked back with gratitude to a childhood under her care.</p>
<p>Perhaps her best known work is the 'Early Lessons for Children,'
which was written during this period. Coming as it did when, as
Hannah More said, there was nothing for children to read between
'Cinderella' and the Spectator, it was largely welcomed, and has
been used by generations of English children. The lessons were
written for a real little Charles, her adopted son, the child of
her brother, Dr. Aikin. For him, too, she wrote her 'Hymns in Prose
for Children,' a book equally successful, which has been translated
into French, German, Spanish, Italian, and even Latin.</p>
<p>After eleven busy years at Palgrave, during which, in spite of
her cheerful energy, Mrs. Barbauld had been much harassed by the
nervous irritability of her invalid husband, the Barbaulds gave up
their school and treated themselves to a year of Continental
travel. On their return they settled at Hampstead, where Mr.
Barbauld became pastor of a small Unitarian congregation. The
nearness to London was a great advantage to Mrs. Barbauld's
refreshed activity, and she soon made the new home a pleasant
rendezvous for literary men and women. At one of her London dinner
parties she met Sir Walter Scott, who declared that her reading of
Taylor's translation of B&uuml;rger's 'Lenore' had inspired him to
write poetry. She met Dr. Johnson too, who, though he railed at her
after his fashion, calling her Deborah and Virago Barbauld, did
sometimes betray a sincere admiration for her character and
accomplishments. Miss Edgeworth and Hannah More were dear friends
and regular correspondents.</p>
<p>From time to time she published a poem or an essay; not many,
for in spite of her brother's continual admonition to write, hers
was a somewhat indolent talent. In 1790 she wrote a capable essay
upon the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts; a year later, a
poetical epistle to Mr. Wilberforce on the Slave Trade; in 1792, a
defense of Public Worship; and in 1793, a discourse as to a Fast
Day upon the Sins of Government.</p>
<p>In 1808 her husband's violent death, the result of a long
insanity, prostrated her for a time. Then as a diversion from
morbid thought she undertook an edition of the best English novels
in fifty volumes, for which she wrote an admirable introductory
essay. She also made a compilation from the Spectator, Tatler,
Guardian, and Free-holder, with a preliminary discourse, which she
published in 1811. It was called 'The Female Speaker,' and intended
for young women. The same year her 'Eighteen Hundred and Eleven,' a
patriotic didactic poem, wounded national self-love and drew upon
her much unfriendly criticism, which so pained her that she would
publish no more. But the stirring lines were widely read, and in
them Macaulay found the original of his famous traveler from New
Zealand, who meditates on the ruined arches of London Bridge. Her
prose style, in its light philosophy, its humorously sympathetic
dealing with every-day affairs, has been often compared with
Addison's.</p>
<p>Her old age was serene and happy, rich in intellectual
companionships and in the love and respect of many friends.
Somewhere she speaks of "that state of middling life to which I
have been accustomed and which I love." She disliked extremes, in
emotion as in all things, and took what came with cheerful courage.
The poem 'Life,' which the self-satisfied Wordsworth wished that he
had written, expresses her serene and philosophic spirit.</p>
<br>
<a name="BARBAULD_01"></a>
<center><b>AGAINST INCONSISTENCY IN OUR EXPECTATIONS</b></center>
<br>
<p>As most of the unhappiness in the world arises rather from
disappointed desires than from positive evil, it is of the utmost
consequence to attain just notions of the laws and order of the
universe, that we may not vex ourselves with fruitless wishes, or
give way to groundless and unreasonable discontent. The laws of
natural philosophy, indeed, are tolerably understood and attended
to; and though we may suffer inconveniences, we are seldom
disappointed in consequence of them. No man expects to preserve
orange-trees in the open air through an English winter; or when he
has planted an acorn, to see it become a large oak in a few months.
The mind of man naturally yields to necessity; and our wishes soon
subside when we see the impossibility of their being gratified.</p>
<p>Now, upon an accurate inspection, we shall find in the moral
government of the world, and the order of the intellectual system,
laws as determinate, fixed, and invariable as any in Newton's
'Principia.' The progress of vegetation is not more certain than
the growth of habit; nor is the power of attraction more clearly
proved than the force of affection or the influence of example. The
man, therefore, who has well studied the operations of nature in
mind as well as matter, will acquire a certain moderation and
equity in his claims upon Providence. He never will be disappointed
either in himself or others. He will act with precision; and expect
that effect and that alone, from his efforts, which they are
naturally adapted to produce.</p>
<p>For want of this, men of merit and integrity often censure the
dispositions of Providence for suffering characters they despise to
run away with advantages which, they yet know, are purchased by
such means as a high and noble spirit could never submit to. If you
refuse to pay the price, why expect the purchase? We should
consider this world as a great mart of commerce, where fortune
exposes to our view various commodities,--riches, ease,
tranquillity, fame, integrity, knowledge. Everything is marked at a
settled price. Our time, our labor, our ingenuity, is so much ready
money which we are to lay out to the best advantage. Examine,
compare, choose, reject; but stand to your own judgment: and do
not, like children, when you have purchased one thing, repine that
you do not possess another which you did not purchase. Such is the
force of well-regulated industry, that a steady and vigorous
exertion of our faculties, directed to one end, will generally
insure success.</p>
<p>Would you, for instance, be rich: Do you think that single point
worth the sacrificing everything else to? You may then be rich.
Thousands have become so from the lowest beginnings, by toil, and
patient diligence, and attention to the minutest article of expense
and profit. But you must give up the pleasures of leisure, of a
vacant mind, of a free, unsuspicious temper. If you preserve your
integrity, it must be a coarse-spun and vulgar honesty. Those high
and lofty notions of morals which you brought with you from the
schools must be considerably lowered, and mixed with the baser
alloy of a jealous and worldly-minded prudence. You must learn to
do hard if not unjust things; and for the nice embarrassments of a
delicate and ingenuous spirit, it is necessary for you to get rid
of them as fast as possible. You must shut your heart against the
Muses, and be content to feed your understanding with plain,
household truths. In short, you must not attempt to enlarge your
ideas, or polish your taste, or refine your sentiments; but must
keep on in one beaten track, without turning aside either to the
right hand or to the left. "But I cannot submit to drudgery like
this: I feel a spirit above it." 'Tis well: be above it then; only
do not repine that you are not rich.</p>
<p>Is knowledge the pearl of price? That too may be purchased--by
steady application, and long solitary hours of study and
reflection. Bestow these, and you shall be wise. "But" (says the
man of letters) "what a hardship is it that many an illiterate
fellow who cannot construe the motto of the arms on his coach,
shall raise a fortune and make a figure, while I have little more
than the common conveniences of life." <i>Et tibi magni
satis</i>!--Was it in order to raise a fortune that you consumed
the sprightly hours of youth in study and retirement? Was it to be
rich that you grew pale over the midnight lamp, and distilled the
sweetness from the Greek and Roman spring? You have then mistaken
your path, and ill employed your industry. "What reward have I then
for all my labors?" What reward! A large, comprehensive soul, well
purged from vulgar fears and perturbations and prejudices; able to
comprehend and interpret the works of man--of God. A rich,
flourishing, cultivated mind, pregnant with inexhaustible stores of
entertainment and reflection. A perpetual spring of fresh ideas;
and the conscious dignity of superior intelligence. Good heaven!
and what reward can you ask besides?</p>
<p>"But is it not some reproach upon the economy of Providence that
such a one, who is a mean, dirty fellow, should have amassed wealth
enough to buy half a nation?" Not in the least. He made himself a
mean, dirty fellow for that very end. He has paid his health, his
conscience, his liberty, for it; and will you envy him his bargain?
Will you hang your head and blush in his presence because he
outshines you in equipage and show? Lift up your brow with a noble
confidence, and say to yourself, I have not these things, it is
true; but it is because I have not sought, because I have not
desired them; it is because I possess something better. I have
chosen my lot. I am content and satisfied.</p>
<p>You are a modest man--you love quiet and independence, and have
a delicacy and reserve in your temper which renders it impossible
for you to elbow your way in the world, and be the herald of your
own merits. Be content then with a modest retirement, with the
esteem of your intimate friends, with the praises of a blameless
heart, and a delicate, ingenuous spirit; but resign the splendid
distinctions of the world to those who can better scramble for
them.</p>
<p>The man whose tender sensibility of conscience and strict regard
to the rules of morality makes him scrupulous and fearful of
offending, is often heard to complain of the disadvantages he lies
under in every path of honor and profit. "Could I but get over some
nice points, and conform to the practice and opinion of those about
me, I might stand as fair a chance as others for dignities and
preferment." And why can you not? What hinders you from discarding
this troublesome scrupulosity of yours which stands so grievously
in your way? If it be a small thing to enjoy a healthful mind,
sound at the very core, that does not shrink from the keenest
inspection; inward freedom from remorse and perturbation; unsullied
whiteness and simplicity of manners; a genuine integrity,</p>
<blockquote>"Pure in the last recesses of the mind;"</blockquote>
<br>
<p>if you think these advantages an inadequate recompense for what
you resign, dismiss your scruples this instant, and be a
slave-merchant, a parasite, or--what you please.</p>
<blockquote>"If these be motives weak, break off
betimes;"</blockquote>
<br>
<p>and as you have not spirit to assert the dignity of virtue, be
wise enough not to forego the emoluments of vice.</p>
<p>I much admire the spirit of the ancient philosophers, in that
they never attempted, as our moralists often do, to lower the tone
of philosophy, and make it consistent with all the indulgences of
indolence and sensuality. They never thought of having the bulk of
mankind for their disciples; but kept themselves as distinct as
possible from a worldly life. They plainly told men what sacrifices
were required, and what advantages they were which might be
expected.</p>
<blockquote>"Si virtus hoc una potest dare, fortis omissis<br>
Hoc age deliciis ..."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>If you would be a philosopher, these are the terms. You must do
thus and thus; there is no other way. If not, go and be one of the
vulgar.</p>
<p>There is no one quality gives so much dignity to a character as
consistency of conduct. Even if a man's pursuits be wrong and
unjustifiable, yet if they are prosecuted with steadiness and
vigor, we cannot withhold our admiration. The most characteristic
mark of a great mind is to choose some one important object, and
pursue it through life. It was this made C&aelig;sar a great man.
His object was ambition: he pursued it steadily; and was always
ready to sacrifice to it every interfering passion or
inclination.</p>
<p>There is a pretty passage in one of Lucian's dialogues, where
Jupiter complains to Cupid that though he has had so many
intrigues, he was never sincerely beloved. In order to be loved,
says Cupid, you must lay aside your aegis and your thunderbolts,
and you must curl and perfume your hair, and place a garland on
your head, and walk with a soft step, and assume a winning,
obsequious deportment. But, replied Jupiter, I am not willing to
resign so much of my dignity. Then, returns Cupid, leave off
desiring to be loved. He wanted to be Jupiter and Adonis at the
same time.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that men of genius are of all others most
inclined to make these unreasonable claims. As their relish for
enjoyment is strong, their views large and comprehensive, and they
feel themselves lifted above the common bulk of mankind, they are
apt to slight that natural reward of praise and admiration which is
ever largely paid to distinguished abilities; and to expect to be
called forth to public notice and favor: without considering that
their talents are commonly very unfit for active life; that their
eccentricity and turn for speculation disqualifies them for the
business of the world, which is best carried on by men of moderate
genius; and that society is not obliged to reward any one who is
not useful to it. The poets have been a very unreasonable race, and
have often complained loudly of the neglect of genius and the
ingratitude of the age. The tender and pensive Cowley, and the
elegant Shenstone, had their minds tinctured by this discontent;
and even the sublime melancholy of Young was too much owing to the
stings of disappointed ambition.</p>
<p>The moderation we have been endeavoring to inculcate will
likewise prevent much mortification and disgust in our commerce
with mankind. As we ought not to wish in ourselves, so neither
should we expect in our friends, contrary qualifications. Young and
sanguine, when we enter the world, and feel our affections drawn
forth by any particular excellence in a character, we immediately
give it credit for all others; and are beyond measure disgusted
when we come to discover, as we soon must discover, the defects in
the other side of the balance. But nature is much more frugal than
to heap together all manner of shining qualities in one glaring
mass. Like a judicious painter, she endeavors to preserve a certain
unity of style and coloring in her pieces. Models of absolute
perfection are only to be met with in romance; where exquisite
beauty, and brilliant wit, and profound judgment, and immaculate
virtue, are all blended together to adorn some favorite character.
As an anatomist knows that the racer cannot have the strength and
muscles of the draught-horse; and that winged men, griffins, and
mermaids must be mere creatures of the imagination: so the
philosopher is sensible that there are combinations of moral
qualities which never can take place but in idea. There is a
different air and complexion in characters as well as in faces,
though perhaps each equally beautiful; and the excellences of one
cannot be transferred to the other. Thus if one man possesses a
stoical apathy of soul, acts independent of the opinion of the
world, and fulfills every duty with mathematical exactness, you
must not expect that man to be greatly influenced by the weakness
of pity, or the partialities of friendship; you must not be
offended that he does not fly to meet you after a short absence, or
require from him the convivial spirit and honest effusions of a
warm, open, susceptible heart. If another is remarkable for a
lively, active zeal, inflexible integrity, a strong indignation
against vice, and freedom in reproving it, he will probably have
some little bluntness in his address not altogether suitable to
polished life; he will want the winning arts of conversation; he
will disgust by a kind of haughtiness and negligence in his manner,
and often hurt the delicacy of his acquaintance with harsh and
disagreeable truths.</p>
<p>We usually say--That man is a genius, but he has some whims and
oddities--Such a one has a very general knowledge, but he is
superficial, etc. Now in all such cases we should speak more
rationally, did we substitute "therefore" for "but": "He is a
genius, therefore he is whimsical" and the like.</p>
<p>It is the fault of the present age, owing to the freer commerce
that different ranks and professions now enjoy with each other,
that characters are not marked with sufficient strength; the
several classes run too much into one another. We have fewer
pedants, it is true, but we have fewer striking originals. Every
one is expected to have such a tincture of general knowledge as is
incompatible with going deep into any science; and such a
conformity to fashionable manners as checks the free workings of
the ruling passion, and gives an insipid sameness to the face of
society, under the idea of polish and regularity.</p>
<p>There is a cast of manners peculiar and becoming to each age,
sex, and profession; one, therefore, should not throw out illiberal
and commonplace censures against another. Each is perfect in its
kind: a woman as a woman; a tradesman as a tradesman. We are often
hurt by the brutality and sluggish conceptions of the vulgar; not
considering that some there must be to be hewers of wood and
drawers of water, and that cultivated genius, or even any great
refinement and delicacy in their moral feelings, would be a real
misfortune to them.</p>
<p>Let us then study the philosophy of the human mind. The man who
is master of this science will know what to expect from every one.
From this man, wise advice; from that, cordial sympathy; from
another, casual entertainment. The passions and inclinations of
others are his tools, which he can use with as much precision as he
would the mechanical powers; and he can as readily make allowance
for the workings of vanity, or the bias of self-interest in his
friends, as for the power of friction, or the irregularities of the
needle.</p>

<center><b>A DIALOGUE OF THE DEAD</b></center>
<br>
<center>BETWEEN HELEN AND MADAME MAINTENON</center>
<br>
<p><i>Helen</i>--Whence comes it, my dear Madame Maintenon, that
beauty, which in the age I lived in produced such extraordinary
effects, has now lost almost all its power?</p>
<p><i>Maintenon</i>--I should wish first to be convinced of the
fact, before I offer to give you a reason for it.</p>
<p><i>Helen</i>--That will be very easy; for there is no occasion
to go any further than our own histories and experience to prove
what I advance. You were beautiful, accomplished, and fortunate;
endowed with every talent and every grace to bend the heart of man
and mold it to your wish; and your schemes were successful; for you
raised yourself from obscurity and dependence to be the wife of a
great monarch.--But what is this to the influence my beauty had
over sovereigns and nations! I occasioned a long ten-years' war
between the most celebrated heroes of antiquity; contending
kingdoms disputed the honor of placing me on their respective
thrones; my story is recorded by the father of verse; and my charms
make a figure even in the annals of mankind. You were, it is true,
the wife of Louis XIV., and respected in his court, but you
occasioned no wars; you are not spoken of in the history of France,
though you furnished materials for the memoirs of a court. Are the
love and admiration that were paid you merely as an amiable woman
to be compared with the enthusiasm I inspired, and the boundless
empire I obtained over all that was celebrated, great, or powerful
in the age I lived in?</p>
<p><i>Maintenon</i>--All this, my dear Helen, has a splendid
appearance, and sounds well in a heroic poem; but you greatly
deceive yourself if you impute it all to your personal merit. Do
you imagine that half the chiefs concerned in the war of Troy were
at all influenced by your beauty, or troubled their heads what
became of you, provided they came off with honor? Believe me, love
had very little to do in the affair: Menelaus sought to revenge the
affront he had received; Agamemnon was flattered with the supreme
command; some came to share the glory, others the plunder; some
because they had bad wives at home, some in hopes of getting Trojan
mistresses abroad; and Homer thought the story extremely proper for
the subject of the best poem in the world. Thus you became famous;
your elopement was made a national quarrel; the animosities of both
nations were kindled by frequent battles; and the object was not
the restoring of Helen to Menelaus, but the destruction of Troy by
the Greeks.--My triumphs, on the other hand, were all owing to
myself, and to the influence of personal merit and charms over the
heart of man. My birth was obscure; my fortunes low; I had past the
bloom of youth, and was advancing to that period at which the
generality of our sex lose all importance with the other; I had to
do with a man of gallantry and intrigue, a monarch who had been
long familiarized with beauty, and accustomed to every refinement
of pleasure which the most splendid court in Europe could afford:
Love and Beauty seemed to have exhausted all their powers of
pleasing for him in vain. Yet this man I captivated, I fixed; and
far from being content, as other beauties had been, with the honor
of possessing his heart, I brought him to make me his wife, and
gained an honorable title to his tenderest affection.--The
infatuation of Paris reflected little honor upon you. A thoughtless
youth, gay, tender, and impressible, struck with your beauty, in
violation of all the most sacred laws of hospitality carries you
off, and obstinately refuses to restore you to your husband. You
seduced Paris from his duty, I recovered Louis from vice; you were
the mistress of the Trojan prince, I was the companion of the
French monarch.</p>
<p><i>Helen</i>--I grant you were the wife of Louis, but not the
Queen of France. Your great object was ambition, and in that you
met with a partial success;--my ruling star was love, and I gave up
everything for it. But tell me, did not I show my influence over
Menelaus in his taking me again after the destruction of Troy?</p>
<p><i>Maintenon</i>--That circumstance alone is sufficient to show
that he did not love you with any delicacy. He took you as a
possession that was restored to him, as a booty that he had
recovered; and he had not sentiment enough to care whether he had
your heart or not. The heroes of your age were capable of admiring
beauty, and often fought for the possession of it; but they had not
refinement enough to be capable of any pure, sentimental attachment
or delicate passion. Was that period the triumph of love and
gallantry, when a fine woman and a tripod were placed together for
prizes at a wrestling-bout, and the tripod esteemed the most
valuable reward of the two? No; it is our Cl&eacute;lia, our
Cassandra and Princess of Cleves, that have polished mankind and
taught them how to love.</p>
<p><i>Helen</i>--Rather say you have lost sight of nature and
passion, between bombast on one hand and conceit on the other.
Shall one of the cold temperament of France teach a Grecian how to
love? Greece, the parent of fair forms and soft desires, the nurse
of poetry, whose soft climate and tempered skies disposed to every
gentler feeling, and tuned the heart to harmony and love!--was
Greece a land of barbarians? But recollect, if you can, an incident
which showed the power of beauty in stronger colors--that when the
grave old counselors of Priam on my appearance were struck with
fond admiration, and could not bring themselves to blame the cause
of a war that had almost ruined their country;--you see I charmed
the old as well as seduced the young.</p>
<p><i>Maintenon</i>--But I, after I was grown old, charmed the
young; I was idolized in a capital where taste, luxury, and
magnificence were at the height; I was celebrated by the greatest
wits of my time, and my letters have been carefully handed down to
posterity.</p>
<p><i>Helen</i>--Tell me now sincerely, were you happy in your
elevated fortune?</p>
<p><i>Maintenon</i>--- Alas! Heaven knows I was far otherwise: a
thousand times did I wish for my dear Scarron again. He was a very
ugly fellow, it is true, and had but little money: but the most
easy, entertaining companion in the world: we danced, laughed, and
sung; I spoke without fear or anxiety, and was sure to please. With
Louis all was gloom, constraint, and a painful solicitude to
please--which seldom produces its effect; the king's temper had
been soured in the latter part of life by frequent disappointments;
and I was forced continually to endeavor to procure him that
cheerfulness which I had not myself. Louis was accustomed to the
most delicate flatteries; and though I had a good share of wit, my
faculties were continually on the stretch to entertain him,--a
state of mind little consistent with happiness or ease; I was
afraid to advance my friends or punish my enemies. My pupils at St.
Cyr were not more secluded from the world in a cloister than I was
in the bosom of the court; a secret disgust and weariness consumed
me. I had no relief but in my work and books of devotion; with
these alone I had a gleam of happiness.</p>
<p><i>Helen</i>--Alas! one need not have married a great monarch
for that.</p>
<p><i>Maintenon</i>--But deign to inform me, Helen, if you were
really as beautiful as fame reports? for to say truth, I cannot in
your shade see the beauty which for nine long years had set the
world in arms.</p>
<p><i>Helen</i>--Honestly, no: I was rather low, and something
sunburnt; but I had the good fortune to please; that was all. I was
greatly obliged to Homer.</p>
<p><i>Maintenon</i>--And did you live tolerably with Menelaus after
all your adventures?</p>
<p><i>Helen</i>--As well as possible. Menelaus was a good-natured
domestic man, and was glad to sit down and end his days in quiet. I
persuaded him that Venus and the Fates were the cause of all my
irregularities, which he complaisantly believed. Besides, I was not
sorry to return home: for to tell you a secret, Paris had been
unfaithful to me long before his death, and was fond of a little
Trojan brunette whose office it was to hold up my train; but it was
thought dishonorable to give me up. I began to think love a very
foolish thing: I became a great housekeeper, worked the battles of
Troy in tapestry, and spun with my maids by the side of Menelaus,
who was so satisfied with my conduct, and behaved, good man, with
so much fondness, that I verily think this was the happiest period
of my life.</p>
<p><i>Maintenon</i>--Nothing more likely; but the most obscure wife
in Greece could rival you there.--Adieu! you have convinced me how
little fame and greatness conduce to happiness.</p>

<h2>ALEXANDER BARCLAY</h2>
<h3>(1475-1552)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-b.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>arclay's reputation rests upon his translation of the famous
'Ship of Fools' and his original 'Eclogues.' A controversy as to
the land of his birth--an event which happened about the year
1475--has lasted from his century to our own. The decision in favor
of Scotland rests upon the testimony of two witnesses: first, Dr.
William Bullim, a younger contemporary of Barclay, who mentions him
in 'A Dialogue Both Pleasaunt and Pietifull Wherein is a Godlie
Regement Against the Fever Pestilence with a Consolation and
Comforte Against Death,' which was published in 1564; and secondly,
Barclay himself.</p>
<p>Bullim groups the Muses at the foot of Parnassus, and gathers
about them Greek and Latin poets, and such Englishmen as Chaucer,
Gower, Skelton, and Barclay, the latter "with an hoopyng russet
long coate, with a pretie hood in his necke, and five knottes upon
his girdle, after Francis's tricks. He was borne beyond the cold
river of Twede. He lodged upon a sweetebed of chamomill under the
sinamone-tree: about him many shepherdes and shepe, with pleasaunte
pipes; greatly abhorring the life of Courtiers, Citizens, Usurers,
and Banckruptes, etc., whose daies are miserable. And the estate of
shepherdes and countrie people he accompted moste happie and sure."
Deprived of its poetic fancy, this passage means that Barclay was a
monk of the order of St. Francis, that he was born north of the
Tweed, that his verse was infused with such bitterness and tonic
qualities as camomile possesses, and that he advocated the cause of
the country people in his independent and admirable 'Eclogues,'
another title for the first three of which is 'Miseryes of
Courtiers and Courtes of all Princes in General.'</p>
<p>Barclay was educated at Oxford and Cambridge, and upon his
return to England after several years of residence abroad, he was
made one of the priests of Saint Mary Ottery, an institution of
devout practice and learning in Devonshire. Here in 1508 was
finished 'The Shyp of Folys of the Worlde translated out of Laten,
Frenche, and Doche into Englysshe tonge by Alexander Barclay,
Preste, and at that time chaplen in the sayd College.'</p>
<p>After his work was completed Barclay went to London, where his
poem was "imprentyd ... in Fleet Street at the signe of Saynt
George by Rycharde Pyreson to hys Coste and charge: ended the yere
of our Saviour MDIX. the XIII. day of December." That he became a
Benedictine and lived at the monastery of the order at Ely is
evident from his 'Eclogues.' Here he translated at the instance of
Sir Giles Arlington, Knight, 'The Myrrour of Good Maners,' from a
Latin elegiac poem which Dominic Mancini published in the year
1516.</p>
<p>"It was about this period of his life," says Mr. Jamieson in his
admirable edition of the 'Ship of Fools,' "probably the period of
the full bloom of his popularity, that the quiet life of the poet
and priest was interrupted by the recognition of his eminence in
the highest quarters, and by a request for his aid in maintaining
the honor of the country on an occasion to which the eyes of all
Europe were then directed. In a letter to Wolsey dated 10th April,
1520, Sir Nicholas Vaux--busied with the preparation for that
meeting of Henry VIII and Francis I called the Field of the Cloth
of Gold--begs the Cardinal to send them ... Maistre Barkleye, the
Black Monke and Poete, to devise histoires and convenient raisons
to florisshe the buildings and banquet house withal."</p>
<p>He became a Franciscan, the habit of which order Bullim refers
to; and "sure 'tis," says Wood, "that living to see his monastery
dissolv'd, in 1539, at the general dissolution by act of Henry
VIII, he became vicar of Much Badew in Essex, and in 1546, the same
year, of the Church of St. Matthew the Apostle at Wokey, in
Somersetshire, and finally in 1552, the year in which he died, of
that of All Saints, Lombard Street, London. In his younger days he
was esteemed a good poet and orator, but when years came on, he
spent his time mostly in pious matters, and in reading the
histories of Saints."</p>
<p>'The Ship of Fools' is the most important work associated with
Barclay's name. It was a translation of Sebastian Brandt's
'Stultifera Navis,' a book which had attracted universal attention
on the Continent when it appeared in 1494. In his preface, Barclay
admits that "it is not translated word by word according to the
verses of my actor. For I have but only drawn into our mother
tongue in rude language the sentences of the verses as near as the
paucity of my wit will suffer me, sometime adding, sometime
detracting and taking away such things as seemeth me necessary."
The classes and conditions of society that Barclay knew were as
deserving of satire as those of Germany. He tells us that his work
was undertaken "to cleanse the vanity and madness of foolish
people, of whom over great number is in the Realm of England."</p>
<p>The diction of Barclay's version is exceptionally fine. Jamieson
calls it "a rich and unique exhibition of early art," and
says:--"Page after page, even in the antique spelling of Pynson's
edition, may be read by the ordinary reader of to-day without
reference to a dictionary; and when reference is required, it will
be found in nine cases out of ten that the archaism is Saxon, not
Latin. This is all the more remarkable that it occurs in the case
of a priest translating mainly from the Latin and French, and can
only be explained with reference to his standpoint as a social
reformer of the broadest type, and to his evident intention that
his book should be an appeal to all classes, but especially to the
mass of people for amendment of their follies."</p>
<p>As the original work belonged to the German satirist, the
extract from the 'Ship of Fools' is placed under the essay entitled
'Sebastian Brandt.' His 'Eclogues' show Barclay at his best. They
portray the manners and customs of the period, and are full of
local proverbs and wise sayings. According to Warton, Barclay's are
the first 'Eclogues' that appeared in the English language. "They
are like Petrarch's," he says, "and Mantuans of the moral and
satirical kind; and contain but few touches of moral description
and bucolic imagery." Two shepherds meet to talk about the
pleasures and crosses of rustic life and life at court. The hoary
locks of the one show that he is old. His suit of Kendal green is
threadbare, his rough boots are patched, and the torn side of his
coat reveals a bottle never full and never empty. His wallet
contains bread and cheese; he has a crook, and an oaten pipe. His
name is Cornix, and he boasts that he has had worldly experience.
The other shepherd, Coridon, having seen nothing, complains of
country life. He grumbles at the summer's heat and the winter's
cold; at beds on the flinty ground, and the dangers of sleeping
where the wolves may creep in to devour the sheep; of his stiff
rough hands, and his parched, wrinkled, and weather-beaten skin. He
asks whether all men are so unhappy. Cornix, refreshing himself at
intervals with his bottle and crusts, shows him the small amount of
liberty at court, discourses upon the folly of ambition, lays bare
the rapine, avarice, and covetousness of the worldly-minded, and
demonstrates that the court is "painted fair without, but within it
is ugly and vile." He then gives the picture of a courtier's life,
which is cited below. He tells how the minstrels and singers,
philosophers, poets, and orators are but the slaves of patronizing
princes; how beautiful women deceive; describes to him, who has
known nothing but a diet of bread and cheese, the delights of the
table; dilates on the cups of silver and gold, and the crystal
glass shining with red and yellow wine; the sewers bearing in
roasted crane, gorgeous peacocks, and savory joints of beef and
mutton; the carver wielding his dexterous knife; the puddings, the
pasties, the fish fried in sweet oils and garnished with herbs; the
costumes of the men and women in cloth of gold and silver and gay
damask; the din of music, voices, laughter, and jests; and then
paints a picture of the lords and ladies who plunge their knives
into the meats and their hands into platters, spilling wine and
gravy upon their equally gluttonous neighbors. He finishes by
saying:--</p>
<blockquote>"Shepherds have not so wretched lives as they: Though
they live poorely on cruddes, chese, and whey, On apples, plummes,
and drinke cleree water deepe, As it were lordes reigning among
their sheepe. The wretched lazar with clinking of his bell, Hath
life which doth the courtiers excell; The caytif begger hath meate
and libertie, When courtiers hunger in harde captivitie. The poore
man beggeth nothing hurting his name, As touching courters they
dare not beg for shame. And an olde proverb is sayde by men moste
sage, That oft yonge courters be beggars in their
age."</blockquote>
<p>The third 'Eclogue' begins with Coridon relating a dream that he
went to court and saw the scullions standing</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i11">"about me thicke</p>
<p class="i2">With knives ready for to flay me quicke."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a text for Cornix, who continues his tirade, and
convinces Coridon of the misery of the court and his happier life,
ending as follows:--</p>
<blockquote>"Than let all shepheardes, from hence to Salisbury With
easie riches, live well, laugh and be mery, Pipe under shadowes,
small riches hath most rest, In greatest seas moste sorest is
tempest, The court is nought els but a tempesteous sea; Avoyde the
rockes. He ruled after me."</blockquote>
<p>The fourth 'Eclogue' is a dialogue on the rich man's treatment
of poets, by two shepherds, Codrus and Menalcas, musing in "shadowe
on the green," while their snowy flocks graze on the sweet meadow.
This contains a fine allegorical description of 'Labour.'</p>
<p>The fifth 'Eclogue' is the 'Cytezen and the Uplondyshman.' Here
the scene changes, and two shepherds, Faustus and Amyntas,
discourse in a cottage while the snows of January whirl without.
Amyntas has learned in London "to go so manerly." Not a wrinkle may
be found in his clothes, not a hair on his cloak, and he wears a
brooch of tin high on his bonnet. He has been hostler,
costermonger, and taverner, and sings the delights of the city.
Faustus, the rustic, is contented with his lot. The 'Cytezen and
the Uplondyshman' was printed from the original edition of Wynkyn
de Worde, with a preface by F. W. Fairholt, Percy Society (Vol.
xxii.).</p>
<p>Other works ascribed to Barclay are:--'The Figure of Our Holy
Mother Church, Oppressed by the French King'; 'The Lyfe of the
Glorious Martyr Saynt George,' translated (from Mantuan) by
Alexander Barclay; 'The Lyfe of the Blessed Martyr, Saynte Thomas';
'Contra Skeltonum,' in which the quarrel he had with his
contemporary poet, John Skelton, was doubtless continued.</p>
<p>Estimates of Barclay may be found in 'The Ship of Fools,' edited
by T.H. Jamieson (1874); 'Sibbald's Chronicle of Scottish Poetry,'
from the thirteenth century to the union of the crowns (1802); 'The
History of English Poetry,' by Thomas Warton (1824); 'The History
of Scottish Poetry,' by David Irving (1861); and 'Chips from a
German Workshop,' by F. Max M&uuml;ller (1870).</p>

<h2>RICHARD HARRIS BARHAM</h2>

""></p>
<p>he author of the 'Ingoldsby Legends' belonged to a well-defined
and delightful class of men, chiefly found in modern England, and
indeed mostly bred and made possible by the conditions of English
society and the Anglican Church. It is that of clergymen who in the

<p>and indeed love it dearly, but are as firm in principle and

or narrow devotees.</p>
<p>By far the best remembered of this class, for themselves or
their work, are Sydney Smith and Richard Harris Barham; but their
relative repute is one of the oddest paradoxes in literary history.
Roughly speaking, the one is remembered and unread, the other read
and unremembered. Sydney Smith's name is almost as familiar to the
masses as Scott's, and few could tell a line that he wrote;
Barham's writing is almost as familiar as Scott's, and few would
recognize his name. Yet he is in the foremost rank of humorists;
his place is wholly unique, and is likely to remain so. It will be
an age before a similar combination of tastes and abilities is
found once more. Macaulay said truly of Sir Walter Scott that he
"combined the minute learning of an antiquary with the fire of a
great poet." Barham combined a like learning in different fields,
and joined to a different outlook and temper of mind, with the
quick perceptions of a great wit, the brimming zest and high
spirits of a great joker, the genial nature and lightness of a born
man of the world, and the gifts of a wonderful improvisatore in
verse. Withal, he had just enough of serious purpose to give much
of his work a certain measure of cohesive unity, and thus impress
it on the mind as no collection of random skits could do. That
purpose is the feathering which steadies the arrows and sends them
home.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to know that one who has given so good a time to
others had a very good time himself; that we are not, as so often
happens, relishing a farce that stood for tragedy with the maker,
and substituting our laughter for his tears. Barham had the cruel
sorrows of personal bereavement so few escape; but in material
things his career was wholly among pleasant ways. He was well born
and with means, well educated, well nurtured. He was free from the
sordid squabbles or anxious watching and privation which fall to
the lot of so many of the best. He was happy in his marriage and
its attendant home and family, and most fortunate in his
friendships and the superb society he enjoyed. His birth and
position as a gentleman of good landed family, combined with his
profession, opened all doors to him.</p>
<p>But it was the qualities personal to himself, after all, which
made these things available for enjoyment. His desires were
moderate; he counted success what more eager and covetous natures
might have esteemed comparative failure. His really strong
intellect and wide knowledge and cultivation enabled him to meet
the foremost men of letters on equal terms. His kind heart,
generous nature, exuberant fun, and entertaining conversation
endeared him to every one and made his company sought by every one;
they saved much trouble from coming upon him and lightened what did
come. And no blight could have withered that perennial fountain of
jollity, drollery, and light-heartedness. But these were only the
ornaments of a stanchly loyal and honorable nature, and a lovable
and unselfish soul. One of his friends writes of him thus:--</p>
<blockquote>"The profits of agitating pettifoggers would have
materially lessened in a district where he acted as a magistrate;
and duels would have been nipped in the bud at his regimental mess.
It is not always an easy task to do as you would be done by; but to
think as you would be thought of and thought for, and to feel as
you would be felt for, is perhaps still more difficult, as superior
powers of tact and intellect are here required in order to second
good intentions. These faculties, backed by an uncompromising love
of truth and fair dealing, indefatigable good nature, and a nice
sense of what was due to every one in the several relations of
life, both gentle and simple, rendered our late friend invaluable,
either as an adviser or a peacemaker, in matters of delicate and
difficult handling."</blockquote>
<p>Barham was born in Canterbury, England, December 6th, 1788, and
died in London, June 17th, 1845. His ancestry was superior, the
family having derived its name from possessions in Kent in Norman
days. He lost his father--a genial <i>bon vivant</i> of literary
tastes who seems like a reduced copy of his son--when but five
years old; and became heir to a fair estate, including Tappington
Hall, the picturesque old gabled mansion so often imaginatively
misdescribed in the 'Ingoldsby Legends,' but really having the
famous blood-stained stairway. He had an expensive private
education, which was nearly ended with his life at the age of
fourteen by a carriage accident which shattered and mangled his
right arm, crippling it permanently. As so often happens, the
disaster was really a piece of good fortune: it turned him to or
confirmed him in quiet antiquarian scholarship, and established
connections which ultimately led to the 'Legends'; he may owe
immortality to it.</p>
<p>After passing through St. Paul's (London) and Brasenose
(Oxford), he studied law, but finally entered the church. After a
couple of small curacies in Kent, he was made rector of Snargate
and curate of Warehorn, near Romney Marsh; all four in a district
where smuggling was a chief industry, and the Marsh in especial a
noted haunt of desperadoes (for smugglers then took their lives in
their hands), of which the 'Legends' are rich in reminiscences. In
1819, during this incumbency, he wrote a novel, 'Baldwin,' which
was a failure; and part of another, 'My Cousin Nicholas,' which,
finished fifteen years later, had fair success as a serial in
Blackwood's Magazine.</p>
<p>An opportunity offering in 1821, he stood for a minor canonry in
St. Paul's Cathedral, London, and obtained it; his income was less
than before, but he had entered the metropolitan field, which
brought him rich enjoyment and permanent fame. He paid a terrible
price for them: his unhealthy London house cost him the lives of
three of his children. To make up for his shortened means he became
editor of the London Chronicle and a contributor to various other
periodicals, including the notorious weekly John Bull, sometime
edited by Theodore Hook. In 1824 he became a priest in the Chapel
Royal at St. James's Palace, and soon after gained a couple of
excellent livings in Essex, which put him at ease financially.</p>
<p>He was inflexible in principle, a firm Tory, though without
rancor. He was very High Church, but had no sympathy with the
Oxford movement or Catholicism. He preached careful and sober
sermons, without oratorical display and with rigid avoidance of
levity. He would not make the church a field either for fireworks
or jokes, or even for displays of scholarship or intellectual
gymnastics. In his opinion, religious establishments were kept up
to advance religion and morals. And both he and his wife wrought
zealously in the humble but exacting field of parochial good
works.</p>
<p>He was, however, fast becoming one of the chief ornaments of
that brilliant group of London wits whose repute still vibrates
from the early part of the century. Many of them--actors, authors,
artists, musicians, and others met at the Garrick Club, and Barham
joined it. The names of Sydney Smith and Theodore Hook are enough
to show what it was; but there were others equally delightful,--not
the least so, or least useful, a few who could not see a joke at
all, and whose simplicity and good nature made them butts for the
hoaxes and solemn chaff of the rest. Barbara's diary, quoted in his
son's (Life,) gives an exquisite instance.</p>
<p>In 1834 his old schoolmaster Bentley established Bentley's
Miscellany; and Barham was asked for contributions. The first he
sent was the amusing but quite "conceivable" (Spectre of
Tappington); but there soon began the immortal series of versified
local stories, legendary church miracles, antiquarian curios, witty
summaries of popular plays, skits on London life, and so on, under
the pseudonym of 'Thomas Ingoldsby,' which sprang instantly into
wide popularity, and have never fallen from public favor since--nor
can they till appreciation of humor is dead in the world. They were
collected and illustrated by Leech, Cruikshank, and others, who
were inspired by them to some of their best designs: perhaps the
most perfect realization in art of the Devil in his moments of
jocose triumph is Leech's figure in 'The House-Warming.' A later
series appeared in Colburn's New Monthly Magazine in 1843.</p>
<p>He wrote some excellent pieces (of their kind) in prose, besides
the one already mentioned: the weird and well-constructed 'Leech of
Folkestone' and the 'Passage in the Life of Henry Harris,' both
half-serious tales of mediaeval magic; the thoroughly Ingoldsbian
'Legend of Sheppey,' with its irreverent farce, high animal
spirits, and antiquarianism; the equally characteristic 'Lady
Rohesia,' which would be vulgar but for his sly wit and drollery.
But none of these are as familiar as the versified 'Legends,' nor
have they the astonishing variety of entertainment found in the
latter.</p>
<p>The 'Ingoldsby Legends' have been called an English
naturalization of the French metrical <i>contes;</i> but Barham
owes nothing to his French models save the suggestion of method and
form. Not only is his matter all his own, but he has
<i>Anglified</i> the whole being of the metrical form itself. His
facility of versification, the way in which the whole language
seems to be liquid in his hands and ready to pour into any channel
of verse, was one of the marvelous things of literature. It did not
need the free random movement of the majority of the tales, where
the lines may be anything from one foot to six, from spondaic to
dactylic: in some of them he tied himself down to the most rigid
and inflexible metrical forms, and moved as lightly and freely in
those fetters as if they were non-existent. As to the astonishing
rhymes which meet us at every step, they form in themselves a
poignant kind of wit; often double and even treble, one word
rhyming with an entire phrase or one phrase with another,--not only
of the oddest kind, but as nicely adapted to the necessities of
expression and meaning as if intended or invented for that purpose
alone,--they produce on us the effect of the richest humor.</p>
<p>One of his most diverting "properties" is the set of "morals" he
draws to everything, of nonsensical literalness and infantile
gravity, the perfection of solemn fooling. Thus in the 'Lay of St.
Cuthbert,' where the Devil has captured the heir of the house,</p>
<blockquote>"Whom the nurse had forgot and left there in his chair,
Alternately sucking his thumb and his pear,"</blockquote>
<p>the moral is drawn, among others,--</p>
<blockquote>"Perhaps it's as well to keep children from plums,<br>
And pears in their season--and sucking their thumbs."</blockquote>
<p>And part of the moral to the 'Lay of St. Medard' is--</p>
<blockquote>"Don't give people nicknames! don't, even in fun,<br>
Call any one 'snuff-colored son of a gun'!"</blockquote>
<p>And they generally wind up with some slyly shrewd piece of
worldly wisdom and wit. Thus, the closing moral to 'The
Blasphemer's Warning' is:--</p>
<blockquote>"To married men this--For the rest of your lives,<br>
Think how your misconduct may act on your wives!<br>
Don't swear then before them, lest haply they faint,<br>
Or--what sometimes occurs--run away with a Saint!"</blockquote>
<p>Often they are broader yet, and intended for the club rather
than the family. Indeed, the tales as a whole are club tales, with
an audience of club-men always in mind; not, be it remembered,
bestialities like their French counterparts, or the later English
and American improvements on the French, not even objectionable for
general reading, but full of exclusively masculine joking,
allusions, and winks, unintelligible to the other sex, and not
welcome if they were intelligible.</p>
<p>He has plenty of melody, but it is hardly recognized because of
the doggerel meaning, which swamps the music in the farce. And this
applies to more important things than the melody. The average
reader floats on the surface of this rapid and foamy stream,
covered with sticks and straws and flowers and bonbons, and never
realizes its depth and volume. This light frothy verse is only the
vehicle of a solid and laborious antiquarian scholarship, of an
immense knowledge of the world and society, books and men. He
modestly disclaimed having any imagination, and said he must always
have facts to work upon. This was true; but the same may be said of
some great poets, who have lacked invention except around a
skeleton ready furnished. What was true of Keats and Fitzgerald
cannot nullify the merit of Barham. His fancy erected a huge and
consistent superstructure on a very slender foundation. The same
materials lay ready to the hands of thousands of others, who,
however, saw only stupid monkish fables or dull country
superstition.</p>
<p>His own explanation of his handling of the church legends
tickles a critic's sense of humor almost as much as the verses
themselves. It is true that while differing utterly in his tone of
mind, and his attitude toward the mediaeval stories, from that of
the mediaeval artists and sculptors,--whose gargoyles and other
grotesques were carved without a thought of travesty on anything
religious,--he is at one with them in combining extreme irreverence
of form with a total lack of irreverence of spirit toward the real
spiritual mysteries of religion. He burlesques saints and devils
alike, mocks the swarm of miracles of the mediaeval Church, makes
salient all the ludicrous aspects of mediaeval religious faith in
its devout credulity and barbarous gropings; yet he never sneers at
holiness or real aspiration, and through all the riot of fun in his
masques, one feels the sincere Christian and the warm-hearted man.
But he was evidently troubled by the feeling that a clergyman ought
not to ridicule any form in which religious feeling had ever
clothed itself; and he justified himself by professing that he
wished to expose the absurdity of old superstitions and mummeries
to help countervail the effect of the Oxford movement. Ingoldsby as
a soldier of Protestantism, turning monkish stories into rollicking
farces in order to show up what he conceived to be the errors of
his opponents, is as truly Ingoldsbian a figure as any in his own
'Legends.' Yet one need not accuse him of hypocrisy or falsehood,
hardly even of self-deception. He felt that dead superstitions, and
stories not reverenced even by the Church that developed them, were
legitimate material for any use he could make of them; he felt that
in dressing them up with his wit and fancy he was harming nothing
that existed, nor making any one look lightly on the religion of
Christ or the Church of Christ: and that they were the property of
an opposing church body was a happy thought to set his conscience
at rest. He wrote them thenceforth with greater peace of mind and
added satisfaction, and no doubt really believed that he was doing
good in the way he alleged. And if the excuse gave to the world
even one more of the inimitable 'Legends,' it was worth feeling and
making.</p>
<p>Barham's nature was not one which felt the problems and
tragedies of the world deeply. He grieved for his friends, he
helped the distresses he saw, but his imagination rested closely in
the concrete. He was incapable of <i>weltschmerz</i>; even for
things just beyond his personal ken he had little vision or fancy.
His treatment of the perpetual problem of sex-temptations and
lapses is a good example: he never seems to be conscious of the
tragedy they envelop. To him they are always good jokes, to wink
over or smile at or be indulgent to. No one would ever guess from
'Ingoldsby' the truth he finds even in 'Don Juan,' that</p>
<blockquote>"A heavy price must all pay who thus err,<br>
In some shape."</blockquote>
<p>But we cannot have everything: if Barham had been sensitive to
the tragic side of life, he could not have been the incomparable
fun-maker he was. We do not go to the 'Ingoldsby Legends' to solace
our souls when hurt or remorseful, to brace ourselves for duty, or
to feel ourselves nobler by contact with the expression of
nobility. But there must be play and rest for the senses, as well
as work and aspiration; and there are worse services than relieving
the strain of serious endeavor by enabling us to become jolly
pagans once again for a little space, and care naught for the
morrow.</p>

<p class="i2">On the whole, it was better, he thought, to
retire</p>
<p class="i2">With the curly-wigged boy he'd picked out of the

Bath).</p>
<p class="i6">So to Old Nick's appeal,</p>

<p class="i2">In Le Grosvenor's assuming the arms Le Scroope
swore</p>

<h2>SABINE BARING-GOULD</h2>
<h3>(1834-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould was born in Exeter, England, in
1834. The addition of Gould to the name of Baring came in the time
of his great-grandfather, a brother of Sir Francis Baring, who
married an only daughter and heiress of W.D. Gould of Devonshire.
Much of the early life of Baring-Gould was passed in Germany and
France, and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he graduated in
1854, taking orders ten years later, and in 1881 becoming rector of
Lew Trenchard, Devonshire, where he holds estates and privileges
belonging to his family.</p>
<p>He has worked in many fields, and in all with so much acceptance
that a list of his books would be the best exposition of the range
of his untiring pen. To a gift of ready words and ready
illustration, whether he concerns himself with diversities of early
Christian belief, the course of country-dances in England, or the
growth of mediaeval legends, he adds the grace of telling a tale
and drawing a character. He has published nearly a hundred volumes,
not one of them unreadable. But no one man may write with equal pen
of German history, of comparative mythology and philology, of
theological dissertations, and of the pleasures of English rural
life, while he adds to these a long list of novels.</p>
<p>His secret of popularity lies not in his treatment, which is
neither critical nor scientific, but rather in a clever, easy,
diffuse, jovial, amusing way of saying clearly what at the moment
comes to him to say. His books have a certain raciness and spirit
that recall the English squire of tradition. They rarely smell of
the lamp. Now and then appears a strain of sturdy scholarship,
leading the reader to wonder what his author might have
accomplished had he not enjoyed the comfortable ease of a country
justice of the peace, and a rector with large landed estates, to
whom his poorer neighbors appear a sort of dancing puppets.</p>
<p>Between 1857 and 1870, Baring-Gould had published nine volumes,
the best known of these being 'Curious Myths of the Middle Ages.'
From 1870 to 1890 his name appeared as author on the title-page of
forty-three books: sermons, lectures, essays, archaeological
treatises, memoirs, curiosities of literature, histories, and
fiction; sixteen novels, tales, and romances being included. From
1890 to 1896 he published seventeen more novels, and many of his
books have passed through several editions. His most successful
novels are 'Mehalah; a Tale of the Salt Marshes,' 'In the Roar of
the Sea,' 'Red Spider,' 'Richard Cable,' and 'No&eacute;mi; a Story
of Rock-Dwellers.'</p>
<p>In an essay upon his fiction, Mr. J.M. Barrie writes in The
Contemporary Review (February, 1890):--</p>
<blockquote>"Of our eight or ten living novelists who are popular
by merit, few have greater ability than Mr. Baring-Gould. His
characters are bold and forcible figures, his wit is as ready as
his figures of speech are apt. He has a powerful imagination, and
is quaintly fanciful. When he describes a storm, we can see his
trees breaking in the gale. So enormous and accurate is his general
information that there is no trade or profession with which he does
not seem familiar. So far as scientific knowledge is concerned, he
is obviously better equipped than any contemporary writer of
fiction. Yet one rises from his books with a feeling of repulsion,
or at least with the glad conviction that his ignoble views of life
are as untrue as the characters who illustrate them. Here is a
melancholy case of a novelist, not only clever but sincere, undone
by want of sympathy. . . . The author's want of sympathy prevents
'Mehalah's' rising to the highest art; for though we shudder at the
end, there the effect of the story stops. It illustrates the
futility of battling with fate, but the theme is not allowable to
writers with the modern notion of a Supreme Power. . . . But
'Mehalah' is still one of the most powerful romances of recent
years."</blockquote>

<center><b>ST. PATRICK'S PURGATORY</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Curious Myths of the Middle Ages'</center>
<br>
<p>In that charming mediaeval romance 'Fortunatus and his Sons,'
which by the way is a treasury of popular mythology, is an account
of a visit paid by the favored youth to that cave of mystery in
Lough Derg, the Purgatory of St. Patrick.</p>
<p>Fortunatus, we are told, had heard in his travels of how two
days' journey from the town Valdric, in Ireland, was a town,
Vernic, where was the entrance to the Purgatory; so thither he went
with many servants. He found a great abbey, and behind the altar of
the church a door, which led into the dark cave which is called the
Purgatory of St. Patrick. In order to enter it, leave had to be
obtained from the abbot; consequently Leopold, servant to
Fortunatus, betook himself to that worthy and made known to him
that a nobleman from Cyprus desired to enter the mysterious cavern.
The abbot at once requested Leopold to bring his master to supper
with him. Fortunatus bought a large jar of wine and sent it as a
present to the monastery, and followed at the meal-time.</p>
<p>"Venerable sir!" said Fortunatus, "I understand the Purgatory of
St. Patrick is here: is it so?"</p>
<p>The abbot replied, "It is so indeed. Many hundred years ago,
this place, where stand the abbey and the town, was a howling
wilderness. Not far off, however, lived a venerable hermit, Patrick
by name, who often sought the desert for the purpose of therein
exercising his austerities. One day he lighted on this cave, which
is of vast extent. He entered it, and wandering on in the dark,
lost his way, so that he could no more find how to return to the
light of day. After long ramblings through the gloomy passages, he
fell on his knees and besought Almighty God, if it were His will,
to deliver him from the great peril wherein he lay. Whilst Patrick
thus prayed, he was ware of piteous cries issuing from the depths
of the cave, just such as would be the wailings of souls in
purgatory. The hermit rose from his orison, and by God's mercy
found his way back to the surface, and from that day exercised
greater austerities, and after his death he was numbered with the
saints. Pious people, who had heard the story of Patrick's
adventure in the cave, built this cloister on the site."</p>
<p>Then Fortunatus asked whether all who ventured into the place
heard likewise the howls of the tormented souls.</p>
<p>The abbot replied, "Some have affirmed that they have heard a
bitter crying and piping therein; whilst others have heard and seen
nothing. No one, however, has penetrated as yet to the furthest
limits of the cavern."</p>
<p>Fortunatus then asked permission to enter, and the abbot
cheerfully consented, only stipulating that his guest should keep
near the entrance and not ramble too far, as some who had ventured
in had never returned.</p>
<p>Next day early, Fortunatus received the Blessed Sacrament with
his trusty Leopold; the door of the Purgatory was unlocked, each
was provided with a taper, and then with the blessing of the abbot
they were left in total darkness, and the door bolted behind them.
Both wandered on in the cave, hearing faintly the chanting of the
monks in the church, till the sound died away. They traversed
several passages, lost their way, their candles burned out, and
they sat down in despair on the ground, a prey to hunger, thirst,
and fear.</p>
<p>The monks waited in the church hour after hour; and the visitors
of the Purgatory had not returned. Day declined, vespers were sung,
and still there was no sign of the two who in the morning had
passed from the church into the cave. Then the servants of
Fortunatus began to exhibit anger, and to insist on their master
being restored to them. The abbot was frightened, and sent for an
old man who had once penetrated far into the cave with a ball of
twine, the end attached to the door-handle. This man volunteered to
seek Fortunatus, and providentially his search was successful.
After this the abbot refused permission to any one to visit the
cave.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry II. lived Henry of Saltrey, who wrote a
history of the visit of a Knight Owen to the Purgatory of St.
Patrick, which gained immense popularity, ... was soon translated
into other languages, and spread the fable through mediaeval
Europe.... In English there are two versions. In one of these,
'Owayne Miles,' the origin of the purgatory is thus
described:--</p>
<blockquote>"Holy byschoppes some tyme ther were,<br>
That tawgte me of Goddes lore.<br>
In Irlonde preched Seyn Patryke;<br>
In that londe was non hym lyke:<br>
He prechede Goddes worde full wyde,<br>
And tolde men what shullde betyde.<br>
Fyrste he preched of Heven blysse,<br>
Who ever go thyder may ryght nowgt mysse:<br>
Sethen he preched of Hell pyne,<br>
Howe we them ys that cometh therinne:<br>
And then he preched of purgatory,<br>
As he fonde in hisstory;<br>
But yet the folke of the contr&eacute;<br>
Beleved not that hit mygth be;<br>
And seyed, but gyf hit were so,<br>
That eny non myth hymself go,<br>
And se alle that, and come ageyn,<br>
Then wolde they beleve fayn."</blockquote>
<p>Vexed at the obstinacy of his hearers, St. Patrick besought the
Almighty to make the truth manifest to the unbelievers;
whereupon</p>
<blockquote>"God spakke to Saynt Patryke tho<br>
By nam, and badde hym with Hym go:<br>
He ladde hym ynte a wyldernesse,<br>
Wher was no reste more no lesse,<br>
And shewed that he might se<br>
Inte the erthe a pryv&eacute; entr&eacute;:<br>
Hit was yn a depe dyches ende.<br>
'What mon,' He sayde, 'that wylle hereyn wende,<br>
And dwelle theryn a day and a nyght,<br>
And hold his byleve and ryght,<br>
And come ageyn that he ne dwelle,<br>
Mony a mervayle he may of telle.<br>
And alle tho that doth thys pylgrymage,<br>
I shalle hem graunt for her wage,<br>
Whether he be sqwyer or knave,<br>
Other purgatorye shalle he non have.'"</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon St. Patrick, "he ne stynte ner day ne night," till he
had built there a "fayr abbey," and stocked it with pious canons.
Then he made a door to the cave, and locked the door, and gave the
key to the keeping of the prior. The Knight Owain, who had served
under King Stephen, had lived a life of violence and dissolution;
but filled with repentance, he sought by way of penance St.
Patrick's Purgatory. Fifteen days he spent in preliminary devotions
and alms-deeds, and then he heard mass, was washed with holy water,
received the Holy Sacrament, and followed the sacred relics in
procession, whilst the priests sang for him the Litany, "as lowde
as they mygth crye." Then Sir Owain was locked in the cave, and he
groped his way onward in darkness, till he reached a glimmering
light; this brightened, and he came out into an underground land,
where was a great hall and cloister, in which were men with shaven
heads and white garments. These men informed the knight how he was
to protect himself against the assaults of evil spirits. After
having received this instruction, he heard "grete dynn," and</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;"Then come ther develes on every syde,<br>
Wykked gostes, I wote, fro Helle,<br>
So mony that no tonge mygte telle:<br>
They fylled the hows yn two rowes;<br>
Some grenned on hym and some mad mowes."</blockquote>
<p>He then visits the different places of torment. In one, the
souls are nailed to the ground with glowing hot brazen nails; in
another they are fastened to the soil by their hair, and are bitten
by fiery reptiles. In another, again, they are hung over fires by
those members which had sinned, whilst others are roasted on spits.
In one place were pits in which were molten metals. In these pits
were men and women, some up to their chins, others to their
breasts, others to their hams. The knight was pushed by the devils
into one of these pits and was dreadfully scalded, but he cried to
the Savior and escaped. Then he visited a lake where souls were
tormented with great cold; and a river of pitch, which he crossed
on a frail and narrow bridge. Beyond this bridge was a wall of
glass, in which opened a beautiful gate, which conducted into
Paradise. This place so delighted him that he would fain have
remained in it had he been suffered, but he was bidden return to
earth and finish there his penitence. He was put into a shorter and
pleasanter way back to the cave than that by which he had come; and
the prior found the knight next morning at the door, waiting to be
let out, and full of his adventures. He afterwards went on a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and ended his life in piety....</p>
<p>Froissart tells us of a conversation he had with one Sir William
Lisle, who had been in the Purgatory. "I asked him of what sort was
the cave that is in Ireland, called St. Patrick's Purgatory, and if
that were true which was related of it. He replied that there
certainly was such a cave, for he and another English knight had
been there whilst the king was at Dublin, and said that they
entered the cave, and were shut in as the sun set, and that they
remained there all night and left it next morning at sunrise. And
then I asked if he had seen the strange sights and visions spoken
of. Then he said that when he and his companion had passed the gate
of the Purgatory of St. Patrick, that they had descended as though
into a cellar, and that a hot vapor rose towards them and so
affected their heads that they were obliged to sit down on the
stone steps. And after sitting there awhile they felt heavy with
sleep, and so fell asleep, and slept all night. Then I asked if
they knew where they were in their sleep, and what sort of dreams
they had had; he answered that they had been oppressed with many
fancies and wonderful dreams, different from those they were
accustomed to in their chambers; and in the morning when they went
out, in a short while they had clean forgotten their dreams and
visions; wherefore he concluded that the whole matter was
fancy."</p>
<p>The next to give us an account of his descent into St. Patrick's
Purgatory is William Staunton of Durham, who went down into the
cave on the Friday next after the feast of Holyrood, in the year
1409.</p>
<p>"I was put in by the Prior of St. Matthew, of the same
Purgatory, with procession and devout prayers of the prior, and the
convent gave me an orison to bless me with, and to write the first
word in my forehead, the which prayer is this, 'Jhesu Christe, Fili
Dei vivi, miserere mihi peccatori.' And the prior taught me to say
this prayer when any spirit, good or evil, appeared unto me, or
when I heard any noise that I should be afraid of." When left in
the cave, William fell asleep, and dreamed that he saw coming to
him St. John of Bridlington and St. Ive, who undertook to conduct
him through the scenes of mystery. After they had proceeded a
while, William was found to be guilty of a trespass against Holy
Church, of which he had to be purged before he could proceed much
further. Of this trespass he was accused by his sister, who
appeared in the way. "I make my complaint unto you against my
brother that here standeth; for this man that standeth hereby loved
me, and I loved him, and either of us would have had the other
according to God's law, as Holy Church teaches, and I should have
gotten of me three-souls to God, but my brother hindered us from
marrying." St. John of Bridlington then turned to William, and
asked him why he did not allow the two who loved one another to be
married. "I tell thee there is no man that hindereth man or woman
from being united in the bond of God, though the man be a shepherd
and all his ancestors and the woman be come of kings or of
emperors, or if the man be come of never so high kin and the woman
of never so low kin, if they love one another, but he sinneth in
Holy Church against God and his deed, and therefore he shall have
much pain and tribulations." Being assoiled of this crying sin, St.
John takes William to a fire "grete and styngkyng," in which he
sees people burning in their gay clothes. "I saw some with collars
of gold about their necks, and some of silver, and some men I saw
with gay girdles of silver and gold, and harnessed with horns about
their necks, some with mo jagges on their clothes than whole cloth,
others full of jingles and bells of silver all over set, and some
with long pokes on their sleeves, and women with gowns trailing
behind them a long space, and some with chaplets on their heads of
gold and pearls and other precious stones. And I looked on him that
I saw first in pain, and saw the collars and gay girdles and
baldrics burning, and the fiends dragging him by two fingermits.
And I saw the jagges that men were clothed in turn all to adders,
to dragons, and to toads, and 'many other orrible bestes,' sucking
them, and biting them, and stinging them with all their might, and
through every jingle I saw fiends smite burning nails of fire into
their flesh. I also saw fiends drawing down the skin of their
shoulders like to pokes, and cutting them off, and drawing them to
the heads of those they cut them from, all burning as fire. And
then I saw the women that had side trails behind them, and the side
trails cut off by the fiends and burned on their head; and some
took of the cutting all burning and stopped therewith their mouths,
their noses, and their ears. I saw also their gay chaplets of gold
and pearls and precious stones turned into nails of iron, burning,
and fiends with burning hammers smiting them into their heads."
These were proud and vain people. Then he saw another fire, where
the fiends were putting out people's eyes and pouring molten brass
and lead into the sockets, and tearing off their arms and the nails
of their feet and hands, and soldering them on again. This was the
doom of swearers. William saw other fires wherein the devils were
executing tortures varied and horrible on their unfortunate
victims. We need follow him no further.</p>
<p>At the end of the fifteenth century the Purgatory in Lough Derg
was destroyed by orders of the Pope, on hearing the report of a
monk of Eymstadt in Holland, who had visited it, and had satisfied
himself that there was nothing in it more remarkable than in any
ordinary cavern. The Purgatory was closed on St. Patrick's Day,
1497; but the belief in it was not so speedily banished from
popular superstition. Calderon made it the subject of one of his
dramas; and it became the subject of numerous popular chap-books in
France and Spain, where during last century it occupied in the
religious belief of the people precisely the same position which is
assumed by the marvelous visions of heaven and hell sold by hawkers
in England at the present day.</p>

<center><b>THE CORNISH WRECKERS</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'The Vicar of Morwenstow'</center>
<br>
<p>When the Rev. R.S. Hawker came to Morwenstow in 1834, he found
that he had much to contend with, not only in the external
condition of church and vicarage, but also in that which is of
greater importance....</p>
<p>"The farmers of the parish were simple-hearted and respectable;
but the denizens of the hamlet, after receiving the wages of the
harvest time, eked out a precarious existence in the winter, and
watched eagerly and expectantly for the shipwrecks that were
certain to happen, and upon the plunder of which they surely
calculated for the scant provision of their families. The wrecked
goods supplied them with the necessaries of life, and the rended
planks of the dismembered vessel contributed to the warmth of the
hovel hearthstone.</p>
<p>"When Mr. Hawker came to Morwenstow, 'the cruel and covetous
natives of the strand, the wreckers of the seas and rocks for
flotsam and jetsam,' held as an axiom and an injunction to be
strictly obeyed:--</p>
<blockquote>"'Save a stranger from the sea,<br>
And he'll turn your enemy!'</blockquote>
<p>"The Morwenstow wreckers allowed a fainting brother to perish in
the sea before their eyes without extending a hand of safety,--nay,
more, for the egotistical canons of a shipwreck, superstitiously
obeyed, permitted and absolved the crime of murder by 'shoving the
drowning man into the sea,' to be swallowed by the waves. Cain!
Cain! where is thy brother? And the wrecker of Morwenstow answered
and pleaded in excuse, as in the case of undiluted brandy after
meals, 'It is Cornish custom.' The illicit spirit of Cornish custom
was supplied by the smuggler, and the gold of the wreck paid him
for the cursed abomination of drink."</p>
<p>One of Mr. Hawker's parishioners, Peter Barrow, had been for
full forty years a wrecker, but of a much more harmless
description: he had been a watcher of the coast for such objects as
the waves might turn up to reward his patience. Another was Tristam
Pentire, a hero of contraband adventure, and agent for sale of
smuggled cargoes in bygone times. With a merry twinkle of the eye,
and in a sharp and ringing tone, he loved to tell such tales of
wild adventure and of "derring do," as would make the foot of the
exciseman falter and his cheek turn pale.</p>
<p>During the latter years of last century there lived in
Wellcombe, one of Mr. Hawker's parishes, a man whose name is still
remembered with terror--Cruel Coppinger. There are people still
alive who remember his wife.</p>
<p>Local recollections of the man have molded themselves into the
rhyme--</p>
<blockquote>Will you hear of Cruel Coppinger?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came from a foreign land:<br>
He was brought to us by the salt water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was carried away by the wind!"</blockquote>
<p>His arrival on the north coast of Cornwall was signalized by a
terrific hurricane. The storm came up Channel from the south-west.
A strange vessel of foreign rig went on the reefs of Harty Race,
and was broken to pieces by the waves. The only man who came ashore
was the skipper. A crowd was gathered on the sand, on horseback and
on foot, women as well as men, drawn together by the tidings of a
probable wreck. Into their midst rushed the dripping stranger, and
bounded suddenly upon the crupper of a young damsel who had ridden
to the beach to see the sight. He grasped her bridle, and shouting
in some foreign tongue, urged the double-laden animal into full
speed, and the horse naturally took his homeward way. The damsel
was Miss Dinah Hamlyn. The stranger descended at her father's door,
and lifted her off her saddle. He then announced himself as a Dane,
named Coppinger. He took his place at the family board, and there
remained until he had secured the affections and hand of Dinah. The
father died, and Coppinger at once succeeded to the management and
control of the house, which thenceforth became a den and refuge of
every lawless character along the coast. All kinds of wild uproar
and reckless revelry appalled the neighborhood day and night. It
was discovered that an organized band of smugglers, wreckers, and
poachers made this house their rendezvous, and that "Cruel
Coppinger" was their captain. In those days, and in that far-away
region, the peaceable inhabitants were unprotected. There was not a
single resident gentleman of property and weight in the entire
district. No revenue officer durst exercise vigilance west of the
Tamar; and to put an end to all such surveillance at once, the head
of a gauger was chopped off by one of Coppinger's gang on the
gunwale of a boat.</p>
<p>Strange vessels began to appear at regular intervals on the
coast, and signals were flashed from the headlands to lead them
into the safest creek or cove. Amongst these vessels, one, a
full-rigged schooner, soon became ominously conspicuous. She was
for long the chief terror of the Cornish Channel. Her name was The
Black Prince. Once, with Coppinger on board, she led a
revenue-cutter into an intricate channel near the Bull Rock, where,
from knowledge of the bearings, The Black Prince escaped scathless,
while the king's vessel perished with all on board. In those times,
if any landsman became obnoxious to Coppinger's men, he was seized
and carried on board The Black Prince, and obliged to save his life
by enrolling himself in the crew. In 1835, an old man of the age of
ninety-seven related to Mr. Hawker that he had been so abducted,
and after two years' service had been ransomed by his friends with
a large sum. "And all," said the old man very simply, "because I
happened to see one man kill another, and they thought I would
mention it."</p>
<p>Amid such practices, ill-gotten gold began to flow and ebb in
the hands of Coppinger. At one time he had enough money to purchase
a freehold farm bordering on the sea. When the day of transfer
came, he and one of his followers appeared before the lawyer and
paid the money in dollars, ducats, doubloons, and pistoles. The man
of law demurred, but Coppinger with an oath bade him take this or
none. The document bearing Coppinger's name is still extant. His
signature is traced in stern bold characters, and under his
autograph is the word "Thuro" (thorough) also in his own
handwriting.</p>
<p>Long impunity increased Coppinger's daring. There were certain
bridle roads along the fields over which he exercised exclusive
control. He issued orders that no man was to pass over them by
night, and accordingly from that hour none ever did. They were
called "Coppinger's Tracks." They all converged at a headland which
had the name of Steeple Brink. Here the cliff sheered off, and
stood three hundred feet of perpendicular height, a precipice of
smooth rock towards the beach, with an overhanging face one hundred
feet down from the brow. Under this was a cave, only reached by a
cable ladder lowered from above, and made fast below on a
projecting crag. It received the name of "Coppinger's Cave." Here
sheep were tethered to the rock, and fed on stolen hay and corn
till slaughtered; kegs of brandy and hollands were piled around;
chests of tea; and iron-bound sea-chests contained the chattels and
revenues of the Coppinger royalty of the sea....</p>
<p>But the end arrived. Money became scarce, and more than one
armed king's cutter was seen day and night hovering off the land.
So he "who came with the water went with the wind." His
disappearance, like his arrival, was commemorated by a storm.</p>
<p>A wrecker who had gone to watch the shore, saw, as the sun went
down, a full-rigged vessel standing off and on. Coppinger came to
the beach, put off in a boat to the vessel, and jumped on board.
She spread canvas, stood off shore, and with Coppinger in her was
seen no more. That night was one of storm. Whether the vessel rode
it out, or was lost, none knew.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>In 1864 a large ship was seen in distress off the coast. The
Rev. A. Thynne, rector of Kilkhampton, at once drove to Morwenstow.
The vessel was riding at anchor a mile off shore, west of Hartland
Race. He found Mr. Hawker in the greatest excitement, pacing his
room and shouting for some things he wanted to put in his
greatcoat-pockets, and intensely impatient because his carriage was
not round. With him was the Rev. W. Valentine, rector of Whixley in
Yorkshire, then resident at Chapel in the parish of Morwenstow.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" asked the rector of Kilkhampton: "I
shall drive at once to Bude for the lifeboat."</p>
<p>"No good!" thundered the vicar, "no good comes out of the west.
You must go east. I shall go to Clovelly, and then, if that fails,
to Appledore. I shall not stop till I have got a lifeboat to take
those poor fellows off the wreck."</p>
<p>"Then," said the rector of Kilkhampton, "I shall go to Bude, and
see to the lifeboat there being brought out."</p>
<p>"Do as you like; but mark my words, no good comes of turning to
the west. Why," said he, "in the primitive church they turned to
the west to renounce the Devil."</p>
<p>His carriage came to the door, and he drove off with Mr.
Valentine as fast as his horses could spin him along the hilly,
wretched roads.</p>
<p>Before he reached Clovelly, a boat had put off with the mate
from the ship, which was the Margaret Quail, laden with salt. The
captain would not leave the vessel; for, till deserted by him, no
salvage could be claimed. The mate was picked up on the way, and
the three reached Clovelly.</p>
<p>Down the street proceeded the following procession--the street
of Clovelly being a flight of stairs:--</p>
<p><i>First</i>, the vicar of Morwenstow in a claret-colored coat,
with long tails flying in the gale, blue knitted jersey, and
pilot-boots, his long silver locks fluttering about his head. He
was appealing to the fishermen and sailors of Clovelly to put out
in their lifeboat to rescue the crew of the Margaret Quail. The men
stood sulky, lounging about with folded arms, or hands in their
pockets, and sou'-westers slouched over their brows. The women were
screaming at the tops of their voices that they would not have
their husbands and sons and sweethearts enticed away to risk their
lives to save wrecked men. Above the clamor of their shrill tongues
and the sough of the wind rose the roar of the vicar's voice: he
was convulsed with indignation, and poured forth the most sacred
appeals to their compassion for drowning sailors.</p>
<p><i>Second</i> in the procession moved the Rev. W. Valentine,
with purse full of gold in his hand, offering any amount of money
to the Clovelly men, if they would only go forth in the lifeboat to
the wreck.</p>
<p><i>Third</i> came the mate of the Margaret Quail, restrained by
no consideration of cloth, swearing and damning right and left, in
a towering rage at the cowardice of the Clovelly men.</p>
<p><i>Fourth</i> came John, the servant of Mr. Hawker, with bottles
of whisky under his arm, another inducement to the men to relent
and be merciful to their imperiled brethren.</p>
<p>The first appeal was to their love of heaven and to their
humanity; the second was to their pockets, their love of gold; the
third to their terrors, their fear of Satan, to whom they were
consigned; and the fourth to their stomachs, their love of
grog.</p>
<p>But all appeals were in vain. Then Mr. Hawker returned to his
carriage, and drove away farther east to Appledore, where he
secured the lifeboat. It was mounted on a wagon; ten horses were
harnessed to it; and as fast as possible it was conveyed to the
scene of distress.</p>
<p>But in the mean while the captain of the Margaret Quail,
despairing of help and thinking that his vessel would break up
under him, came off in his boat with the rest of the crew, trusting
rather to a rotten boat, patched with canvas which they had tarred
over, than to the tender mercies of the covetous Clovellites, in
whose veins ran the too recent blood of wreckers. The only living
being left on board was a poor dog.</p>
<p>No sooner was the captain seen to leave the ship than the
Clovelly men lost their repugnance to go to sea. They manned boats
at once, gained the Margaret Quail, and claimed three thousand
pounds for salvage.</p>
<p>There was an action in court, as the owners refused to pay such
a sum; and it was lost by the Clovelly men, who however got an
award of twelve hundred pounds. The case turned somewhat on the
presence of the dog on the wreck; and it was argued that the vessel
was not deserted, because a dog had been left on board to keep
guard for its masters. The owner of the cargo failed; and the
amount actually paid to the salvors was six hundred pounds to two
steam-tugs (three hundred pounds each), and three hundred pounds to
the Clovelly skiff and sixteen men.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawker went round the country indignantly denouncing the
sailors of Clovelly, and with justice. It roused all the righteous
wrath in his breast. And as may well be believed, no love was borne
him by the inhabitants of that little fishing village. They would
probably have made a wreck of him had he ventured among them.</p>

<p>he general reader has yet to learn the most private and sacred
events of Miss Jane Barlow's life, now known only to herself and
friends. She is the daughter of Dr. Barlow of Trinity College, and
lives in the seclusion of a collage at Raheny, a hamlet near
Dublin. Her family has been in Ireland for generations, and she
comes of German and Norman stock. As some one has said, the
knowledge and skill displayed in depicting Irish peasant life,
which her books show, are hers not through Celtic blood and
affinities, but by a sympathetic genius and inspiration.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-109.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Jane Barlow.</b></p>
<p>The publication of her writings in book form was preceded by the
appearance of some poems and stories in the magazines, the Dublin
University Review of 1885 containing 'Walled Out; or, Eschatology
in a Bog.' 'Irish Idyls' (1892), and 'Bogland Studies' (of the same
year), show the same pitiful, sombre pictures of Irish peasant life
about the sodden-roofed mud hut and "pitaties" boiling, which only
a genial, impulsive, generous, light-hearted, half-Greek and
half-philosophic people could make endurable to the reader or
attractive to the writer. The innate sweetness of the Irish
character, which the author brings out with fine touches, makes it
worth portrayal. "It is safe to say," writes a critic, "that the
philanthropist or the political student interested in the eternal
Irish problem will learn more from Miss Barlow's twin volumes than
from a dozen Royal Commissions and a hundred Blue Books." Her
sympathy constantly crops out, as, for instance, in the mirthful
tale of 'Jerry Dunne's Basket,' where--</p>
<blockquote>"Andy Joyce had an ill-advised predilection for seeing
things which he called 'dacint and proper' about him, and he built
some highly superior sheds on the lawn, to the bettering, no doubt,
of his cattle's condition. The abrupt raising of his rent by fifty
per cent, was a broad hint which most men would have taken; and it
did keep Andy ruefully quiet for a season or two. Then, however,
having again saved up a trifle, he could not resist the temptation
to drain the swampy corner of the farthest river-field, which was
as kind a bit of land as you could wish, only for the water lying
on it, and in which he afterward raised himself a remarkably fine
crop of white oats. The sight of them 'done his heart good,' he
said, exultantly, nothing recking that it was the last touch of
farmer's pride he would ever feel. Yet on the next quarter-day the
Joyces received notice to quit, and their landlord determined to
keep the vacated holding in his own hands; those new sheds were
just the thing for his young stock. Andy, in fact, had done his
best to improve himself off the face of the earth."</blockquote>
<p>The long story which Miss Barlow has published, 'Kerrigan's
Quality' (1894), is told with her distinguishing charm, but the
book has not the close-knit force of the 'Idyls.' Miss Barlow
herself prefers the 'Bogland Studies,' because, she says, they are
"a sort of poetry." "I had set my heart too long upon being a poet
ever to give up the idea quite contentedly; 'the old hope is
hardest to be lost.' A real poet I can never be, as I have, I fear,
nothing of the lyrical faculty; and a poet without that is worse
than a bird without wings, so, like Mrs. Browning's Nazianzen, I am
doomed to look 'at the lyre hung out of reach.'"</p>
<p>Besides the three books named, Miss Barlow has published 'Mockus
of the Shallow Waters' (1893); 'The End of Elfintown' (1894); 'The
Battle of the Frogs and Mice in English' (1894); 'Maureen's Fairing
and other Stories' (1895); and 'Strangers at Lisconnel,' a second
series of 'Irish Idyls' (1895). In the last book we again have the
sorrows and joys of the small hamlet in the west of Ireland, where
"the broad level spreads away and away to the horizon before and
behind and on either side of you, very sombre-hued, yet less
black-a-vised than more frequent bergs," where in the distance the
mountains "loom up on its borders much less substantial,
apparently, in fabric than so many spirals of blue turf smoke," and
where the curlew's cry "can set a whole landscape to melancholy in
one chromatic phrase."</p>

<center><b>THE WIDOW JOYCE'S CLOAK</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Strangers at Lisconnel'</center>
<br>
<p>Still, although the Tinkers' name has become a byword among us
through a long series of petty offenses rather than any one
flagrant crime, there is a notable misdeed on record against them,
which has never been forgotten in the lapse of many years. It was
perpetrated soon after the death of Mrs. Kilfoyle's mother, the
Widow Joyce, an event which is but dimly recollected now at
Lisconnel, as nearly half a century has gone by. She did not very
long survive her husband, and he had left his roots behind in his
little place at Clonmena, where, as we know, he had farmed not
wisely but too well, and had been put out of it for his pains to
expend his energy upon our oozy black sods and stark-white
bowlders. But instead he moped about, fretting for his fair green
fields, and few proudly cherished beasts,--especially the little
old Kerry cow. And at his funeral the neighbors said, "Ah, bedad,
poor man, God help him, he niver held up his head agin from that
good day to this."</p>
<p>When Mrs. Joyce felt that it behooved her to settle her affairs,
she found that the most important possession she had to dispose of
was her large cloak. She had acquired it at the prosperous time of
her marriage, and it was a very superior specimen of its kind, in
dark-blue cloth being superfine, and its ample capes and capacious
hood being double-lined and quilted and stitched in a way which I
cannot pretend to describe, but which made it a most substantial
and handsome garment. If Mrs. Joyce had been left entirely to her
own choice in the matter, I think she would have bequeathed it to
her younger daughter Theresa, notwithstanding that custom clearly
designated Bessy Kilfoyle, the eldest of the family, as the
heiress. For she said to herself that poor Bessy had her husband
and childer to consowl her, any way, but little Theresa, the
crathur, had ne'er such a thing at all, and wouldn't have, not she,
God love her. "And the back of me hand to some I could name." It
seemed to her that to leave the child the cloak would be almost
like keeping a warm wing spread over her in the cold wide world;
and there was no fear that Bessy would take it amiss.</p>
<p>But Theresa herself protested strongly against such a
disposition, urging for one thing that sure she'd be lost in it
entirely if ever she put it on; a not unfounded objection, as
Theresa was several sizes smaller than Bessy, and even she fell far
short of her mother in stature and portliness. Theresa also said
confidently with a sinking heart, "But sure, anyhow, mother jewel,
what matter about it? 'Twill be all gone to houles and flitters and
thraneens, and so it will, plase goodness, afore there's any talk
of anybody else wearin' it except your own ould self." And she
expressed much the same conviction one day to her next-door
neighbor, old Biddy Ryan, to whom she had run in for the loan of a
sup of sour milk, which Mrs. Joyce fancied. To Biddy's sincere
regret she could offer Theresa barely a skimpy noggin of milk, and
only a meagre shred of encouragement; and by way of eking out the
latter with its sorry substitute, consolation, she said as she
tilted the jug perpendicularly to extract its last drop:--</p>
<p>"Well, sure, me dear, I do be sayin' me prayers for her every
sun goes over our heads that she might be left wid you this great
while yet; 'deed, I do so. But ah, acushla, if we could be keepin'
people that-a-way, would there be e'er a funeral iver goin' black
on the road at all at all? I'm thinkin' there's scarce a one
livin', and he as ould and foolish and little-good-for as you
plase, but some crathur'ill be grudgin' him to his grave, that's
himself may be all the while wishin' he was in it. Or, morebetoken,
how can we tell what quare ugly misfortin' thim that's took is took
out of the road of, that we should be as good as biddin' thim stay
till it comes to ruinate them? So it's prayin' away I am, honey,"
said old Biddy, whom Theresa could not help hating heart-sickly.
"But like enough the Lord might know better than to be mindin' a
word I say."</p>
<p>And it seemed that He did; anyway, the day soon came when the
heavy blue cloak passed into Mrs. Kilfoyle's possession.</p>
<p>At that time it was clear, still autumn weather, with just a
sprinkle of frost white on the wayside grass, like the wraith of
belated moonlight, when the sun rose, and shimmering into rainbow
stars by noon. But about a month later the winter swooped suddenly
on Lisconnel: with wild winds and cold rain that made
crystal-silver streaks down the purple of the great mountainheads
peering in over our bogland.</p>
<p>So one perishing Saturday Mrs. Kilfoyle made up her mind that
she would wear her warm legacy on the bleak walk to Mass next
morning, and reaching it down from where it was stored away among
the rafters wrapped in an old sack, she shook it respectfully out
of its straight-creased folds. As she did so she noticed that the
binding of the hood had ripped in one place, and that the lining
was fraying out, a mishap which should be promptly remedied before
it spread any further. She was not a very expert needlewoman, and
she thought she had better run over the way to consult Mrs.
O'Driscoll, then a young matron, esteemed the handiest and most
helpful person in Lisconnel.</p>
<p>"It's the nathur of her to be settin' things straight wherever
she goes," Mrs. Kilfoyle said to herself as she stood in her
doorway waiting for the rain to clear off, and looking across the
road to the sodden roof which sheltered her neighbor's head. It had
long been lying low, vanquished by a trouble which even she could
not set to rights, and some of the older people say that things
have gone a little crookeder in Lisconnel ever since.</p>
<p>The shower was a vicious one, with the sting of sleet and hail
in its drops, pelted about by gusts that ruffled up the puddles
into ripples, all set on end, like the feathers of a frightened
hen. The hens themselves stood disconsolately sheltering under the
bank, mostly on one leg, as if they preferred to keep up the
slightest possible connection with such a very damp and
disagreeable earth. You could not see far in any direction for the
fluttering sheets of mist, and a stranger who had been coming along
the road from Duffelane stepped out of them abruptly quite close to
Mrs. Kilfoyle's door, before she knew that there was anybody near.
He was a tall, elderly man, gaunt and grizzled, very ragged, and so
miserable-looking that Mrs. Kilfoyle could have felt nothing but
compassion for him had he not carried over his shoulder a bunch of
shiny cans, which was to her mind as satisfactory a passport as a
ticket of leave. For although these were yet rather early days at
Lisconnel, the Tinkers had already begun to establish their
reputation. So when he stopped in front of her and said, "Good-day,
ma'am," she only replied distantly, "It's a hardy mornin'," and
hoped he would move on. But he said, "It's cruel could, ma'am," and
continued to stand looking at her with wide and woful eyes, in
which she conjectured--erroneously, as it happened--hunger for
warmth or food. Under these circumstances, what could be done by a
woman who was conscious of owning a redly glowing hearth with a big
black pot, fairly well filled, clucking and bobbing upon it? To
possess such wealth as this, and think seriously of withholding a
share from anybody who urges the incontestable claim of wanting it,
is a mood altogether foreign to Lisconnel, where the
responsibilities of poverty are no doubt very imperfectly
understood. Accordingly Mrs. Kilfoyle said to the tattered tramp,
"Ah, thin, step inside and have a couple of hot pitaties." And when
he accepted the invitation without much alacrity, as if he had
something else on his mind, she picked for him out of the steam two
of the biggest potatoes, whose earth-colored skins, cracking,
showed a fair flouriness within; and she shook a little heap of
salt, the only relish she had, onto the chipped white plate as she
handed it to him, saying, "Sit you down be the fire, there, and git
a taste of the heat."</p>
<p>Then she lifted her old shawl over her head, and ran out to see
where at all Brian and Thady were gettin' their deaths on her under
the pours of rain; and as she passed the Keoghs' adjacent
door--which was afterward the Sheridans', whence their Larry
departed so reluctantly--young Mrs. Keogh called her to come in and
look at "the child," who, being a new and unique possession, was
liable to develop alarmingly strange symptoms, and had now "woke up
wid his head that hot, you might as well put your hand on the hob
of the grate." Mrs. Kilfoyle stayed only long enough to suggest, as
a possible remedy, a drop of two-milk whey. "But ah, sure, woman
dear, where at all 'ud we come by that, wid the crathur of a goat
scarce wettin' the bottom of the pan?" and to draw reassuring omens
from the avidity with which the invalid grabbed at a sugared crust.
In fact, she was less than five minutes out of her house; but when
she returned to it, she found it empty. First, she noted with a
moderate thrill of surprise that her visitor had gone away leaving
his potatoes untouched; and next, with a rough shock of dismay,
that her cloak no longer lay on the window seat where she had left
it. From that moment she never felt any real doubts about what had
befallen her, though for some time she kept on trying to conjure
them up, and searched wildly round and round and round her little
room, like a distracted bee strayed into the hollow furze-bush,
before she sped over to Mrs. O'Driscoll with the news of her
loss.</p>
<p>It spread rapidly through Lisconnel, and brought the neighbors
together exclaiming and condoling, though not in great force, as
there was a fair going on down beyant, which nearly all the men and
some of the women had attended. This was accounted cruel unlucky,
as it left the place without any one able-bodied and active enough
to go in pursuit of the thief. A prompt start might have overtaken
him, especially as he was said to be a "thrifle lame-futted";
though Mrs. M'Gurk, who had seen him come down the hill, opined
that "'twasn't the sort of lameness 'ud hinder the miscreant of
steppin' out, on'y a quare manner of flourish he had in a one of
his knees, as if he was gatherin' himself up to make an offer at a
grasshopper's lep, and then thinkin' better of it."</p>
<p>Little Thady Kilfoyle reported that he had met the strange man a
bit down the road, "leggin' it along at a great rate, wid a black
rowl of somethin' under his arm that he looked to be crumplin' up
as small as he could,"--the word "crumpling" went acutely to Mrs.
Kilfoyle's heart,--and some long-sighted people declared that they
could still catch glimpses of a receding figure through the
hovering fog on the way toward Sallinbeg.</p>
<p>"I'd think he'd be beyant seein' afore now," said Mrs. Kilfoyle,
who stood in the rain, the disconsolate centre of the group about
her door; all women and children except old Johnny Keogh, who was
so bothered and deaf that he grasped new situations slowly and
feebly, and had now an impression of somebody's house being on
fire. "He must ha' took off wid himself the instiant me back was
turned, for ne'er a crumb had he touched of the pitaties."</p>
<p>"Maybe he'd that much shame in him," said Mrs. O'Driscoll.</p>
<p>"They'd a right to ha' choked him, troth and they had," said Ody
Rafferty's aunt.</p>
<p>"Is it chokin'?" said young Mrs. M'Gurk, bitterly. "Sure the
bigger thief a body is, the more he'll thrive on whatever he gits;
you might think villiny was as good as butter to people's pitaties,
you might so. Sharne how are you? Liker he'd ate all he could
swally in the last place he got the chance of layin' his hands on
anythin'."</p>
<p>"Och, woman alive, but it's the fool you were to let him out of
your sight," said Ody Rafferty's aunt. "If it had been me, I'd
niver ha' took me eyes off him, for the look of him on'y goin' by
made me flesh creep upon me bones."</p>
<p>"'Deed was I," said Mrs. Kilfoyle, sorrowfully, "a fine fool.
And vexed she'd be, rael vexed, if she guessed the way it was gone
on us, for the dear knows what dirty ould rapscallions 'ill get the
wearin' of it now. Rael vexed she'd be."</p>
<p>This speculation was more saddening than the actual loss of the
cloak, though that bereft her wardrobe of far and away its most
valuable property, which should have descended as an heirloom to
her little Katty, who, however, being at present but three months
old, lay sleeping happily unaware of the cloud that had come over
her prospects.</p>
<p>"I wish to goodness a couple of the lads 'ud step home wid
themselves this minit of time," said Mrs. M'Gurk. "They'd come tip
wid him yet, and take it off of him ready enough. And smash his
ugly head for him, if he would be givin' them any impidence."</p>
<p>"Aye, and 'twould be a real charity--the mane baste;--or sling
him in one of the bog-houles," said the elder Mrs. Keogh, a
mild-looking little old woman. "I'd liefer than nine nine-pennies
see thim comin' along. But I'm afeard it's early for thim yet."</p>
<p>Everybody's eyes turned, as she spoke, toward the ridge of the
Knockawn, though with no particular expectation of seeing what they
wished upon it. But behold, just at that moment three figures,
blurred among the gray rain-mists, looming into view.</p>
<p>"Be the powers," said Mrs. M'Gurk, jubilantly, "it's Ody
Rafferty himself. To your sowls! Now you've a great good chance,
ma'am, to be gettin' it back. He's the boy 'ill leg it over all
before him"--for in those days Ody was lithe and limber--"and it's
hard-set the thievin' Turk 'ill be to get the better of him at a
racin' match--Hi--Och." She had begun to hail him with a call eager
and shrill, which broke off in a strangled croak, like a young
cock's unsuccessful effort. "Och, murdher, murdher, murdher," she
said to the bystanders, in a disgusted undertone. "I'll give you me
misfort'nit word thim other two is the p&oacute;lis."</p>
<p>Now it might seem on the face of things that the arrival of
those two active and stalwart civil servants would have been
welcomed as happening just in the nick of time; yet it argues an
alien ignorance to suppose such a view of the matter by any means
possible. The men in invisible green tunics belonged completely to
the category of pitaty-blights, rint-warnin's, fevers, and the like
devastators of life, that dog a man more or less all through it,
but close in on him, a pitiful quarry, when the bad seasons come
and the childer and the old crathurs are starvin' wid the hunger,
and his own heart is broke; therefore, to accept assistance from
them in their official capacity would have been a proceeding most
reprehensibly unnatural. To put a private quarrel or injury into
the hands of the peelers were a disloyal making of terms with the
public foe; a condoning of great permanent wrongs for the sake of a
trivial temporary convenience. Lisconnel has never been skilled in
the profitable and ignoble art of utilizing its enemies. Not that
anybody was more than vaguely conscious of these sentiments, much
less attempted to express them in set terms. When a policeman
appeared there in an inquiring mood, what people said among
themselves was, "Musha cock him up. I hope he'll get his health
till I would be tellin' him," or words to that effect; while in
reply to his questions, they made statements superficially so clear
and simple, and essentially so bewilderingly involved, that the
longest experience could do little more for a constable than teach
him the futility of wasting his time in attempts to disentangle
them.</p>
<p>Thus it was that when Mrs. Kilfoyle saw who Ody's companions
were, she bade a regretful adieu to her hopes of recovering her
stolen property. For how could she set him on the Tinker's
felonious track without apprising them likewise? You might as well
try to huroosh one chicken off a rafter and not scare the couple
that were huddled beside it. The impossibility became more obvious
presently as the constables, striding quickly down to where the
group of women stood in the rain and wind with fluttering shawls
and flapping cap-borders, said briskly, "Good-day to you all. Did
any of yous happen to see e'er a one of them tinkerin' people goin'
by here this mornin'?"</p>
<p>It was a moment of strong temptation to everybody, but
especially to Mrs. Kilfoyle, who had in her mind that vivid picture
of her precious cloak receding from her along the wet road,
recklessly wisped up in the grasp of as thankless a thievin'
black-hearted slieveen as ever stepped, and not yet, perhaps,
utterly out of reach, though every fleeting instant carried it
nearer to that hopeless point. However, she and her neighbors stood
the test unshaken. Mrs. Ryan rolled her eyes deliberatively, and
said to Mrs. M'Gurk, "The saints bless us, was it yisterday or the
day before, me dear, you said you seen a couple of them below, near
ould O'Beirne's?"</p>
<p>And Mrs. M'Gurk replied, "Ah, sure, not at all, ma'am, glory be
to goodness. I couldn't ha' tould you such a thing, for I wasn't
next or nigh the place. Would it ha' been Ody Rafferty's aunt? She
was below there fetchin' up a bag of male, and bedad she came home
that dhreeped, the crathur, you might ha' thought she'd been after
fishin' it up out of the botthom of one of thim bog-houles."</p>
<p>And Mrs. Kilfoyle heroically hustled her Thady into the house,
as she saw him on the brink of beginning loudly to relate his
encounter with a strange man, and desired him to whisht and stay
where he was in a manner so sternly repressive that he actually
remained there as if he had been a pebble dropped into a pool, and
not, as usual, a cork to bob up again immediately.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. M'Gurk made a bold stroke, designed to shake off the
hampering presence of the professionals, and enable Ody's amateur
services to be utilized while there was yet time.</p>
<p>"I declare," she said, "now that I think of it, I seen a feller
crossin' the ridge along there a while ago, like as if he was
comin' from Sallinbeg ways; and according to the apparence of him,
I wouldn't won'er if he <i>was</i> a one of thim tinker
crathures--carryin' a big clump of cans he was, at any rate--I
noticed the shine of thim. And he couldn't ha' got any great way
yet to spake of, supposin' there was anybody lookin' to folly after
him."</p>
<p>But Constable Black crushed her hopes as he replied, "Ah, it's
nobody comin' <i>from</i> Sallinbeg that we've anything to say to.
There's after bein' a robbery last night, down below at Jerry
Dunne's--a shawl as good as new took, that his wife's ragin' over
frantic, along wid a sight of fowl and other things. And the
Tinkers that was settled this long while in the boreen at the back
of his haggard is quit out of it afore daylight this mornin', every
rogue of them. So we'd have more than a notion where the property's
went to if we could tell the road they've took. We thought like
enough some of them might ha' come this way."</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Jerry Dunne was not a popular person in Lisconnel,
where he has even become, as we have seen, proverbial for what we
call "ould naygurliness." So there was a general tendency to say,
"The divil's cure to him," and listen complacently to any details
their visitors could impart. For in his private capacity a
policeman, provided that he be otherwise "a dacint lad," which to
do him justice is commonly the case, may join, with a few
unobtrusive restrictions, in our neighborly gossips; the rule in
fact being--Free admission except on business.</p>
<p>Only Mrs. Kilfoyle was so much cast down by her misfortune that
she could not raise herself to the level of an interest in the
affairs of her thrifty suitor, and the babble of voices relating
and commenting sounded as meaningless as the patter of the drops
which jumped like little fishes in the large puddle at their feet.
It had spread considerably before Constable Black said to his
comrade:--</p>
<blockquote>"Well, Daly, we'd better be steppin' home wid ourselves
as wise as we come, as the man said when he'd axed his road of the
ould black horse in the dark lane. There's no good goin' further,
for the whole gang of them's scattered over the counthry agin now
like a seedin' thistle in a high win'."<br>
<br>
"Aye, bedad," said Constable Daly, "and be the same token, this
win' ud skin a tanned elephant. It's on'y bogged and drenched we'd
git. Look at what's comin' up over there. That rain's snow on the
hills, every could drop of it; I seen Ben Bawn this mornin' as
white as the top of a musharoon, and it's thickenin' wid sleet here
this minute, and so it is."<br>
<br>
The landscape did, indeed, frown upon further explorations. In
quarters where the rain had abated it seemed as if the mists had
curdled on the breath of the bitter air, and they lay floating in
long white bars and reefs low on the track of their own shadow,
which threw down upon the sombre bogland deeper stains of gloom.
Here and there one caught on the crest of some gray-bowldered
knoll, and was teazed into fleecy threads that trailed melting
instead of tangling. But toward the north the horizon was all
blank, with one vast, smooth slant of slate-color, like a
pent-house roof, which had a sliding motion onwards.<br>
<br>
Ody Rafferty pointed to it and said, "Troth, it's teemin' powerful
this instiant up there in the mountains. 'Twill be much if you land
home afore it's atop of you; for 'twould be the most I could do
myself."</blockquote>
<p>And as the constables departed hastily, most people forgot the
stolen cloak for a while to wonder whether their friends would
escape being entirely drowned on the way back from the fair.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kilfoyle, however, still stood in deep dejection at her
door, and said, "Och, but she was the great fool to go let the
likes of him set fut widin' her house."</p>
<p>To console her Mrs. O'Driscoll said, "Ah, sure, sorra a fool
were you, woman dear; how would you know the villiny of him? And if
you'd turned the man away widout givin' him e'er a bit, it's bad
you'd be thinkin' of it all the day after."</p>
<p>And to improve the occasion for her juniors, old Mrs. Keogh
added, "Aye, and morebetoken you'd ha' been committin' a sin."</p>
<p>But Mrs. Kilfoyle replied with much candor, "'Deed, then, I'd a
dale liefer be after committin' a sin, or a dozen sins, than to
have me poor mother's good cloak thieved away on me, and walkin'
wild about the world."</p>
<p>As it happened, the fate of Mrs. Kilfoyle's cloak was very
different from her forecast. But I do not think that a knowledge of
it would have teen consolatory to her by any means. If she had
heard of it, she would probably have said, "The cross of Christ
upon us. God be good to the misfort'nit crathur." For she was not
at all of an implacable temper, and would, under the circumstances,
have condoned even the injury that obliged her to appear at Mass
with a flannel petticoat over her head until the end of her days.
Yet she did hold the Tinkers in a perhaps somewhat too unqualified
reprobation. For there are tinkers and tinkers. Some of them,
indeed, are stout and sturdy thieves,--veritable birds of
prey,--whose rapacity is continually questing for plunder. But some
of them have merely the magpies' and jackdaws' thievish propensity
for picking up what lies temptingly in their way. And some few are
so honest that they pass by as harmlessly as a wedge of high-flying
wild duck. And I have heard it said that to places like Lisconnel
their pickings and stealings have at worst never been so serious a
matter as those of another flock, finer of feather, but not less
predacious in their habits, who roosted, for the most part, a long
way off, and made their collections by deputy.</p>

<h2>JOEL BARLOW</h2>
<h3>(1754-1812)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-o.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ne morning late in the July of 1778, a select company gathered
in the little chapel of Yale College to listen to orations and
other exercises by a picked number of students of the Senior class,
one of whom, named Barlow, had been given the coveted honor of
delivering what was termed the 'Commencement Poem.' Those of the
audience who came from a distance carried back to their homes in
elm-shaded Norwich, or Stratford, or Litchfield, high on its hills,
lively recollections of a handsome young man and of his 'Prospect
of Peace,' whose cheerful prophecies in heroic verse so greatly
"improved the occasion." They had heard that he was a farmer's son
from Redding, Connecticut, who had been to school at Hanover, New
Hampshire, and had entered Dartmouth College, but soon removed to
Yale on account of its superior advantages; that he had twice seen
active service in the Continental army, and that he was engaged to
marry a beautiful New Haven girl.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-123.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Joel Barlow.</b></p>
<p>The brilliant career predicted for Barlow did not begin
immediately. Distaste for war, hope of securing a tutorship in
college, and--we may well believe--Miss Ruth's entreaties, kept him
in New Haven two years longer, engaged in teaching and in various
courses of study. 'The Prospect of Peace' had been issued in
pamphlet form, and the compliments paid the author incited him to
plan a poem of a philosophic character on the subject of America at
large, bearing the title 'The Vision of Columbus.' The appointment
as tutor never came, and instead of cultivating the Muse in
peaceful New Haven, he was forced to evoke her aid in a tent on the
banks of the Hudson, whither after a hurried course in theology, he
proceeded as an army chaplain in 1780. During his connection with
the army, which lasted until its disbandment in 1783, he won repute
by lyrics written to encourage the soldiers, and by "a flaming
political sermon," as he termed it, on the treason of Arnold.</p>
<p>Army life ended, Barlow removed to Hartford, where he studied
law, edited the American Mercury,--a weekly paper he had helped to
found,--- and with John Trumbull, Lemuel Hopkins, and David
Humphreys formed a literary club which became widely known as the
"Hartford Wits." Its chief publication, a series of political
lampoons styled 'The Anarchiad,' satirized those factions whose
disputes imperiled the young republic, and did much to influence
public opinion in Connecticut and elsewhere in favor of the Federal
Constitution. A revision and enlargement of Dr. Watts's 'Book of
Psalmody,' and the publication (1787) of his own 'Vision of
Columbus,' occupied part of Barlow's time while in Hartford. The
latter poem was extravagantly praised, ran through several
editions, and was republished in London and Paris; but the poet,
who now had a wife to support, could not live by his pen nor by the
law, and when in 1788 he was urged by the Scioto Land Company to
become its agent in Paris, he gladly accepted. The company was a
private association, formed to buy large tracts of government land
situated in Ohio and sell them in Europe to capitalists or actual
settlers. This failed disastrously, and Barlow was left stranded in
Paris, where he remained, supporting himself partly by writing,
partly by business ventures. Becoming intimate with the leaders of
the Girondist party, the man who had dedicated his 'Vision of
Columbus' to Louis XVI., and had also dined with the nobility, now
began to figure as a zealous Republican and as a Liberal in
religion. From 1790 to 1793 he passed most of his time in London,
where he wrote a number of political pamphlets for the Society for
Constitutional Information, an organization openly favoring French
Republicanism and a revision of the British Constitution. Here
also, in 1791, he finished a work entitled 'Advice to the
Privileged Orders,' which probably would have run through many
editions had it not been suppressed by the British government. The
book was an arraignment of tyranny in church and state, and was
quickly followed by 'The Conspiracy of Kings,' an attack in verse
on those European countries which had combined to kill
Republicanism in France. In 1792 Barlow was made a citizen of
France as a mark of appreciation of a 'Letter' addressed to the
National Convention, giving that body advice, and when the
convention sent commissioners to organize the province of Savoy
into a department, Barlow was one of the number. As a candidate for
deputy from Savoy, he was defeated; but his visit was not
fruitless, for at Chamb&eacute;ry the sight of a dish of maize-meal
porridge reminded him of his early home in Connecticut, and
inspired him to write in that ancient French town a typical Yankee
poem, 'Hasty Pudding.' Its preface, in prose, addressed to Mrs.
Washington, assured her that simplicity of diet was one of the
virtues; and if cherished by her, as it doubtless was, it would be
more highly regarded by her countrywomen.</p>
<p>Between the years of 1795-97, Barlow held the important but
unenviable position of United States Consul at Algiers, and
succeeded both in liberating many of his countrymen who were held
as prisoners, and in perfecting treaties with the rulers of the
Barbary States, which gave United States vessels entrance to their
ports and secured them from piratical attacks. On his return to
Paris he translated Volney's 'Ruins' into English, made
preparations for writing histories of the American and French
revolutions, and expanded his 'Vision of Columbus' into a volume
which as 'The Columbiad'--a beautiful specimen of typography--was
published in Philadelphia in 1807 and republished in London. The
poem was held to have increased Barlow's fame; but it is stilted
and monotonous, and 'Hasty Pudding' has done more to perpetuate his
name.</p>
<p>In 1805 Barlow returned to the United States and bought an
estate near Washington, D.C., where he entertained distinguished
visitors. In 1811 he returned to France authorized to negotiate a
treaty of commerce. After waiting nine months, he was invited by
Napoleon, who was then in Poland, to a conference at Wilna. On his
arrival Barlow found the French army on the retreat from Moscow,
and endured such privations on the march that on December 24th he
died of exhaustion at the village of Zarnowiec, near Cracow, and
there was buried.</p>
<p>Barlow's part in developing American literature was important,
and therefore he has a rightful place in a work which traces that
development. He certainly was a man of varied ability and power,
who advanced more than one good cause and stimulated the movement
toward higher thought. The only complete 'Life and Letters of Joel
Barlow,' by Charles Burr Todd, published in 1888, gives him
unstinted praise as excelling in statesmanship, letters, and
philosophy. With more assured justice, which all can echo, it
praises his nobility of spirit as a man. No one can read the letter
to his wife, written from Algiers when he thought himself in danger
of death, without a warm feeling for so unselfish and affectionate
a nature.</p>

<center><b>A FEAST</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Hasty Pudding'</center>
<br>
<p>There are various ways of preparing and eating Hasty Pudding,
with molasses, butter, sugar, cream, and fried. Why so excellent a
thing cannot be eaten alone? Nothing is perfect alone; even man,
who boasts of so much perfection, is nothing without his
fellow-substance. In eating, beware of the lurking heat that lies
deep in the mass; dip your spoon gently, take shallow dips and cool
it by degrees. It is sometimes necessary to blow. This is indicated
by certain signs which every experienced feeder knows. They should
be taught to young beginners. I have known a child's tongue
blistered for want of this attention, and then the school-dame
would insist that the poor thing had told a lie. A mistake: the
falsehood was in the faithless pudding. A prudent mother will cool
it for her child with her own sweet breath. The husband, seeing
this, pretends his own wants blowing, too, from the same lips. A
sly deceit of love. She knows the cheat, but, feigning ignorance,
lends her pouting lips and gives a gentle blast, which warms the
husband's heart more than it cools his pudding.</p>
<blockquote>The days grow short; but though the falling sun<br>
To the glad swain proclaims his day's work done,<br>
Night's pleasing shades his various tasks prolong,<br>
And yield new subjects to my various song.<br>
For now, the corn-house filled, the harvest home,<br>
The invited neighbors to the husking come;<br>
A frolic scene, where work and mirth and play<br>
Unite their charms to chase the hours away.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the huge heap lies centred in the hall,<br>
The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall,<br>
Brown corn-fed nymphs, and strong hard-handed beaux,<br>
Alternate ranged, extend in circling rows,<br>
Assume their seats, the solid mass attack;<br>
The dry husks rustle, and the corn-cobs crack;<br>
The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound,<br>
And the sweet cider trips in silence round.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws of husking every wight can tell;<br>
And sure, no laws he ever keeps so well:<br>
For each red ear a general kiss he gains,<br>
With each smut ear he smuts the luckless swains;<br>
But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast,<br>
Red as her lips, and taper as her waist,<br>
She walks the round, and culls one favored beau,<br>
Who leaps, the luscious tribute to bestow.<br>
Various the sport, as are the wits and brains<br>
Of well-pleased lasses and contending swains;<br>
Till the vast mound of corn is swept away,<br>
And he that gets the last ear wins the day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the housewife urges all her care,<br>
The well-earned feast to hasten and prepare.<br>
The sifted meal already waits her hand,<br>
The milk is strained, the bowls in order stand,<br>
The fire flames high; and as a pool (that takes<br>
The headlong stream that o'er the mill-dam breaks)<br>
Foams, roars, and rages with incessant toils,<br>
So the vexed caldron rages, roars and boils.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First with clean salt she seasons well the food,<br>
Then strews the flour, and thickens well the flood.<br>
Long o'er the simmering fire she lets it stand;<br>
To stir it well demands a stronger hand:<br>
The husband takes his turn, and round and round<br>
The ladle flies; at last the toil is crowned;<br>
When to the board the thronging huskers pour,<br>
And take their seats as at the corn before.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave them to their feast. There still belong<br>
More useful matters to my faithful song.<br>
For rules there are, though ne'er unfolded yet,<br>
Nice rules and wise, how pudding should be ate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some with molasses grace the luscious treat,<br>
And mix, like bards, the useful and the sweet;<br>
A wholesome dish, and well deserving praise,<br>
A great resource in those bleak wintry days,<br>
When the chilled earth lies buried deep in snow,<br>
And raging Boreas dries the shivering cow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blest cow! thy praise shall still my notes employ,<br>
Great source of health, the only source of joy;<br>
Mother of Egypt's god, but sure, for me,<br>
Were I to leave my God, I'd worship thee.<br>
How oft thy teats these pious hands have pressed!<br>
How oft thy bounties prove my only feast!<br>
How oft I've fed thee with my favorite grain!<br>
And roared, like thee, to see thy children slain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye swains who know her various worth to prize,<br>
Ah! house her well from winter's angry skies.<br>
Potatoes, pumpkins, should her sadness cheer,<br>
Corn from your crib, and mashes from your beer;<br>
When spring returns, she'll well acquit the loan,<br>
And nurse at once your infants and her own.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Milk, then, with pudding I should always choose;<br>
To this in future I confine my muse,<br>
Till she in haste some further hints unfold,<br>
Good for the young, nor useless to the old.<br>
First in your bowl the milk abundant take,<br>
Then drop with care along the silver lake<br>
Your flakes of pudding: these at first will hide<br>
Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide;<br>
But when their growing mass no more can sink,<br>
When the soft island looms above the brink,<br>
Then check your hand; you've got the portion due,<br>
So taught my sire, and what he taught is true.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a choice in spoons. Though small appear<br>
The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clear.<br>
The deep-bowled Gallic spoon, contrived to scoop<br>
In ample draughts the thin diluted soup,<br>
Performs not well in those substantial things,<br>
Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings;<br>
Where the strong labial muscles must embrace<br>
The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space.<br>
With ease to enter and discharge the freight,<br>
A bowl less concave, but still more dilate,<br>
Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size,<br>
A secret rests, unknown to vulgar eyes.<br>
Experienced feeders can alone impart<br>
A rule so much above the lore of art.<br>
These tuneful lips that thousand spoons have tried,<br>
With just precision could the point decide,<br>
Though not in song--the muse but poorly shines<br>
In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines;<br>
Yet the true form, as near as she can tell,<br>
Is that small section of a goose-egg shell,<br>
Which in two equal portions shall divide<br>
The distance from the centre to the side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin;--<br>
Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin<br>
Suspend the ready napkin; or like me,<br>
Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee;<br>
Just in the zenith your wise head project,<br>
Your full spoon rising in a line direct,<br>
Bold as a bucket, heed no drops that fall.<br>
The wide-mouthed bowl will surely catch them all!</blockquote>

<h2>WILLIAM BARNES</h2>
<h3>(1800-1886)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-h.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ad he chosen to write solely in familiar English, rather than in
the dialect of his native Dorsetshire, every modern anthology would
be graced by the verses of William Barnes, and to multitudes who
now know him not, his name would have become associated with many a
country sight and sound. Other poets have taken homely subjects for
their themes,--the hayfield, the chimney-nook, milking-time, the
blossoming of "high-boughed hedges"; but it is not every one who
has sung out of the fullness of his heart and with a na&iuml;ve
delight in that of which he sung: and so by reason of their
faithfulness to every-day life and to nature, and by their
spontaneity and tenderness, his lyrics, fables, and eclogues appeal
to cultivated readers as well as to the rustics whose quaint speech
he made his own.</p>
<p>Short and simple are the annals of his life; for, a brief period
excepted, it was passed in his native county--though Dorset, for
all his purposes, was as wide as the world itself. His birthplace
was Bagbere in the vale of Blackmore, far up the valley of the
Stour, where his ancestors had been freeholders. The death of his
parents while he was a boy threw him on his own resources; and
while he was at school at Sturminster and Dorchester he supported
himself by clerical work in attorneys' offices. After he left
school his education was mainly self-gained; but it was so thorough
that in 1827 he became master of a school at Mere, Wilts, and in
1835 opened a boarding-school in Dorchester, which he conducted for
a number of years. A little later he spent a few terms at
Cambridge, and in 1847 received ordination. From that time until
his death in 1886, most of his days were spent in the little
parishes of Whitcombe and Winterbourne Came, near Dorchester, where
his duties as rector left him plenty of time to spend on his
favorite studies. To the last, Barnes wore the picturesque dress of
the eighteenth century, and to the tourist he became almost as much
a curiosity as the relics of Roman occupation described in a
guide-book he compiled.</p>
<p>When one is at the same time a linguist, a musician, an
antiquary, a profound student of philology, and skilled withal in
the graphic arts, it would seem inevitable that he should have more
than a local reputation; but when, in 1844, a thin volume entitled
'Poems of Rural Life in the Dorset Dialect' appeared in London, few
bookshop frequenters had ever heard of the author. But he was
already well known throughout Dorset, and there he was content to
be known; a welcome guest in castle and hall, but never happier
than when, gathering about him the Jobs and Lettys with whom Thomas
Hardy has made us familiar, he delighted their ears by reciting his
verses. The dialect of Dorset, he boasted, was the least corrupted
form of English; therefore to commend it as a vehicle of expression
and to help preserve his mother tongue from corruption, and to
purge it of words not of Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic origin,--this was
one of the dreams of his life,--he put his impressions of rural
scenery and his knowledge of human character into metrical form. He
is remembered by scholars here and there for a number of works on
philology, and one ('Outline of English Speech-Craft') in which,
with zeal, but with the battle against him, he aimed to teach the
English language by using words of Teutonic derivation only; but it
is through his four volumes of poems that he is better remembered.
These include 'Hwomely Rhymes' (1859), 'Poems of Rural Life'
(1862), and 'Poems of Rural Life in Common English' (1863). The
three collections of dialect poems were brought out in one volume,
with a glossary, in 1879.</p>
<p>"A poet fresh as the dew," "The first of English purely pastoral
poets," "The best writer of eclogues since Theocritus,"--these are
some of the tardy tributes paid him. With a sympathy for his
fellow-man and a humor akin to that of Burns, with a feeling for
nature as keen as Wordsworth's, though less subjective, and with a
power of depicting a scene with a few well-chosen epithets which
recalls Tennyson, Barnes has fairly earned his title to
remembrance.</p>
<p>'The Life of William Barnes, Poet and Philologist,' written by
his daughter, Mrs. Baxter, was published in 1887. There are
numerous articles relating to him in periodical literature, one of
which, a sketch by Thomas Hardy, in Vol. 86 of the 'Athenaeum,' is
of peculiar interest.</p>

<h2>JAMES MATTHEW BARRIE</h2>
<h3>(1860-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ames Matthew Barrie was born May 9th, 1860, at Kirriemuir,
Scotland ('Thrums'); son of a physician whom he has lovingly
embodied as 'Dr. McQueen,' and with a mother and sister who will
live as 'Jess' and 'Leeby.' After an academy course at Dumfries he
entered the University of Edinburgh at eighteen, where he graduated
M.A., and took honors in the English Literature class. A few months
later he took a place on a newspaper in Nottingham, England, and in
the spring of 1885 went to London, where the papers had begun to
accept his work.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-139.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>James M. Barrie.</b></p>
<p>Above all, the St. James's Gazette had published the first of
the 'Auld Licht Idylls' November 17th, 1884; and the editor,
Frederick Greenwood, instantly perceiving a new and rich genius,
advised him to work the vein further, enforcing the advice by
refusing to accept his contributions on other subjects.</p>
<p>He had the usual painful struggle to become a successful
journalist, detailed in 'When a Man's Single'; but his real work
was other and greater. In 1887 'When a Man's Single' came out
serially in the British Weekly; it has little merit except in the
Scottish prelude, which is of high quality in style and pathos. It
is curious how utterly his powers desert him the moment he leaves
his native heath: like Ant&aelig;us, he is a giant on his mother
earth and a pigmy off it. His first published book was 'Better
Dead' (1887); it works out a cynical idea which would be amusing in
five pages, but is diluted into tediousness by being spread over
fifty. But in 1889 came a second masterpiece, 'A Window in Thrums,'
a continuation of the Auld Licht series from an inside instead of
an outside standpoint,--not superior to the first, but their full
equals in a deliciousness of which one cannot say how much is
matter and how much style. 'My Lady Nicotine' appeared in 1890; it
was very popular, and has some amusing sketches, but no enduring
quality. 'An Edinburgh Eleven' (1890) is a set of sketches of his
classmates and professors.</p>
<p>In 1891 the third of his Scotch works appeared,--'The Little
Minister,'--which raised him from the rank of an admirable sketch
writer to that of an admirable novelist, despite its fantastic plot
and detail. Since then he has written three plays,--'Walker,
London,' 'Jane Annie,' and 'The Professor's Love Story,' the latter
very successful and adding to his reputation; but no literature
except his novel 'Sentimental Tommy,' just closed in Scribner's
Magazine. This novel is not only a great advance on 'The Little
Minister' in symmetry of construction, reality of matter, tragic
power, and insight, but its tone is very different. Though as rich
in humor, the humor is largely of a grim, bitter, and sardonic
sort. The light, gay, buoyant fun of 'The Little Minister,' which
makes it a perpetual enjoyment, has mostly vanished; in its stead
we feel that the writer's sensitive nature is wrung by the swarming
catastrophes he cannot avert, the endless wrecks on the ocean of
life he cannot succor, and hardly less by those spiritual tragedies
and ironies so much worse, on a true scale of valuation, than any
material misfortune.</p>
<p>The full secret of Mr. Barrie's genius, as of all genius, eludes
analysis; but some of its characteristics are not hard to define.
His wonderful keenness of observation and tenacity of remembrance
of the pettinesses of daily existence, which in its amazing
minuteness reminds us of Dickens and Mark Twain, and his
sensitiveness to the humorous aspects of their little misfits and
hypocrisies and lack of proportion, might if untempered have made
him a literary cynic like some others, remembered chiefly for the
salience he gave to the ugly meannesses of life and the ironies of
fate. But his good angel added to these a gift of quick, sure, and
spontaneous sympathy and wide spiritual understanding. This fills
all his higher work with a generous appreciativeness, a justness of
judgment, a tenderness of feeling, which elevate as well as charm
the reader. He makes us love the most grotesque characters, whom in
life we should dislike and avoid, by the sympathetic fineness of
his interpretation of their springs of life and their warping by
circumstance. The impression left on one by the studies of the
Thrums community is not primarily of intellectual and spiritual
narrowness, or niggardly thrift, or dour natures: all are there,
but with them are souls reaching after God and often flowering into
beauty, and we reverence the quenchless aspiration of maligned
human nature for an ideal far above its reach. He achieves the rare
feat of portraying every pettiness and prejudice, even the
meannesses and dishonors of a poor and hidebound country village,
yet leaving us with both sincere respect and warm liking for it; a
thing possible only to one himself of a fine nature as well as of a
large mind. Nor is there any mawkishness or cheap surface
sentimentality in it all. His pathos never makes you wince: you can
always read his works aloud, the deadly and unfailing test of
anything flat or pinchbeck in literature. His gift of humor saves
him from this: true humor and true pathos are always found together
because they are not two but one, twin aspects of the very same
events. He who sees the ludicrous in misfits must see their sadness
too; he who can laugh at a tumble must grieve over it: both are
inevitable and both are coincident.</p>
<p>As a literary artist, he belongs in the foremost rank. He has
that sense of the typical in incident, of the universal in feeling,
and of the suggestive in language, which mark the chiefs of
letters. No one can express an idea with fewer strokes; he never
expands a sufficient hint into an essay. His management of the
Scotch dialect is masterly: he uses it sparingly, in the nearest
form to English compatible with retaining the flavor; he never
makes it so hard as to interfere with enjoyment; in few dialect
writers do we feel so little alienness.</p>
<p>'Auld Licht Idylls' is a set of regular descriptions of the life
of "Thrums," with special reference to the ways and character of
the "Old Lights," the stubborn conservative Scotch Puritans; it
contains also a most amusing and characteristic love story of the
sect (given below), and a satiric political skit. 'A Window in
Thrums' is mainly a series of selected incidents in detail, partly
from the point of view of a crippled woman ("Jess"), sitting at her
window and piecing out what she sees with great shrewdness from her
knowledge of the general current of affairs, aided by her daughter
"Leeby." 'The Little Minister' is developed from the real story of
a Scotch clergyman who brought home a wife from afar, of so alien a
sort to the general run that the parish spent the rest of her short
life in speculating on her previous history and weaving legends
about her. Barrie's imagined explanation is of Arabian-Nights
preposterousness of incident, and indeed is only a careless
fairy-tale in substance; but it is so rich in delicious filling, so
full of his best humor, sentiment, character-drawing, and fine
feeling, that one hardly cares whether it has any plot at all.
'Sentimental Tommy' is a study of a sensitive mobile boy, a born
<i>poseur</i>, who passes his life in cloud-castles where he always
dramatizes himself as the hero, who has no continuity of purpose,
and no capacity of self-sacrifice except in spasms of impulse, and
in emotional feeling which is real to itself; a spiritual Proteus
who deceives even himself, and only now and then recognizes his own
moral illusiveness, like Hawthorne's scarecrow-gentleman before the
mirror: but with the irresistible instincts also of the born
literary creator and constructor. The other characters are drawn
with great power and truth.</p>
<p>The judgment of contemporaries is rarely conclusive; and we will
not attempt to anticipate that of posterity. It may be said,
however, that the best applicable touchstone of permanency is that
of seeming continuously fresh to cultivated tastes after many
readings; and that Mr. Barrie's four best books bear the test
without failure.</p>

<center><b>THE COURTING OF T'NOWHEAD'S BELL</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Auld Licht Idylls'</center>
<br>
<p>For two years it had been notorious in the square that Sam'l
Dickie was thinking of courting T'nowhead's Bell, and that if
little Sanders Elshioner (which is the Thrums pronunciation of
Alexander Alexander) went in for her, he might prove a formidable
rival. Sam'l was a weaver in the Tenements, and Sanders a
coal-carter whose trade-mark was a bell on his horse's neck that
told when coals were coming. Being something of a public man,
Sanders had not, perhaps, so high a social position as Sam'l; but
he had succeeded his father on the coal-cart, while the weaver had
already tried several trades. It had always been against Sam'l,
too, that once when the kirk was vacant he had advised the
selection of the third minister who preached for it, on the ground
that it came expensive to pay a large number of candidates. The
scandal of the thing was hushed up, out of respect for his father,
who was a God-fearing man, but Sam'l was known by it in Lang
Tammas's circle. The coal-carter was called Little Sanders, to
distinguish him from his father, who was not much more than half
his size. He had grown up with the name, and its inapplicability
now came home to nobody. Sam'l's mother had been more far-seeing
than Sanders's. Her man had been called Sammy all his life, because
it was the name he got as a boy, so when their eldest son was born
she spoke of him as Sam'l while still in his cradle. The neighbors
imitated her, and thus the young man had a better start in life
than had been granted to Sammy, his father.</p>
<p>It was Saturday evening--the night in the week when Auld Licht
young men fell in love. Sam'l Dickie, wearing a blue Glengarry
bonnet with a red ball on the top, came to the door of a one-story
house in the Tenements, and stood there wriggling, for he was in a
suit of tweeds for the first time that week, and did not feel at
one with them. When his feeling of being a stranger to himself wore
off, he looked up and down the road, which straggles between houses
and gardens, and then, picking his way over the puddles, crossed to
his father's hen-house and sat down on it. He was now on his way to
the square.</p>
<p>Eppie Fargus was sitting on an adjoining dike, knitting
stockings, and Sam'l looked at her for a time.</p>
<p>"Is't yersel, Eppie?" he said at last.</p>
<p>"It's a' that," said Eppie.</p>
<p>"Hoo's a' wi' ye?" asked Sam'l.</p>
<p>"We're juist aff an' on," replied Eppie, cautiously.</p>
<p>There was not much more to say, but as Sam'l sidled off the
hen-house, he murmured politely, "Ay, ay." In another minute he
would have been fairly started, but Eppie resumed the
conversation.</p>
<p>"Sam'l," she said, with a twinkle in her eye, "ye can tell
Lisbeth Fargus I'll likely be drappin' in on her aboot Munday or
Teisday."</p>
<p>Lisbeth was sister to Eppie, and wife of Thomas McQuhatty,
better known as T'nowhead, which was the name of his farm. She was
thus Bell's mistress.</p>
<p>Sam'l leaned against the hen-house, as if all his desire to
depart had gone.</p>
<p>"Hoo d'ye kin I'll be at the T'nowhead the nicht?" he asked,
grinning in anticipation.</p>
<p>"Ou, I'se warrant ye'll be after Bell," said Eppie.</p>
<p>"Am no sae sure o' that," said Sam'l, trying to leer. He was
enjoying himself now.</p>
<p>"Am no sure o' that," he repeated, for Eppie seemed lost in
stitches.</p>
<p>"Sam'l?"</p>
<p>"Ay."</p>
<p>"Ye'll be speirin' her sune noo, I dinna doot?"</p>
<p>This took Sam'l, who had only been courting Bell for a year or
two, a little aback.</p>
<p>"Hoo d'ye mean, Eppie?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Maybe ye'll do't the nicht."</p>
<p>"Na, there's nae hurry," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"Weel, we're a' coontin' on't, Sam'l."</p>
<p>"Gae wa wi' ye."</p>
<p>"What for no?"</p>
<p>"Gae wa wi' ye," said Sam'l again.</p>
<p>"Bell's gei an' fond o' ye, Sam'l."</p>
<p>"Ay," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"But am dootin' ye're a fell billy wi' the lasses."</p>
<p>"Ay, oh, I d'na kin, moderate, moderate," said Sam'l, in high
delight.</p>
<p>"I saw ye," said Eppie, speaking with a wire in her mouth, "gaen
on terr'ble wi' Mysy Haggart at the pump last Saturday."</p>
<p>"We was juist amoosin' oorsels," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"It'll be nae amoosement to Mysy," said Eppie, "gin ye brak her
heart."</p>
<p>"Losh, Eppie," said Sam'l, "I didna think o' that."</p>
<p>"Ye maun kin weel, Sam'l, at there's mony a lass wid jump at
ye."</p>
<p>"Ou, weel," said Sam'l, implying that a man must take these
things as they come.</p>
<p>"For ye're a dainty chield to look at, Sam'l."</p>
<p>"Do ye think so, Eppie? Ay, ay; oh, I d'na kin am onything by
the ordinar."</p>
<p>"Ye mayna be," said Eppie, "but lasses doesna do to be ower
partikler."</p>
<p>Sam'l resented this, and prepared to depart again.</p>
<p>"Ye'll no tell Bell that?" he asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>"Tell her what?"</p>
<p>"Aboot me an' Mysy."</p>
<p>"We'll see hoo ye behave yersel, Sam'l."</p>
<p>"No 'at I care, Eppie; ye can tell her gin ye like. I widna
think twice o' tellin' her mysel."</p>
<p>"The Lord forgie ye for leein', Sam'l," said Eppie, as he
disappeared down Tammy Tosh's close. Here he came upon Henders
Webster.</p>
<p>"Ye're late, Sam'l," said Henders.</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"Ou, I was thinkin' ye wid be gaen the length o' T'nowhead the
nicht, an' I saw Sanders Elshioner makkin's wy there an oor
syne."</p>
<p>"Did ye?" cried Sam'l, adding craftily; "but its naething to
me."</p>
<p>"Tod, lad," said Henders; "gin ye dinna buckle to, Sanders'll be
carryin' her off!"</p>
<p>Sam'l flung back his head and passed on.</p>
<p>"Sam'l!" cried Henders after him.</p>
<p>"Ay," said Sam'l, wheeling round.</p>
<p>"Gie Bell a kiss frae me."</p>
<p>The full force of this joke struck neither all at once. Sam'l
began to smile at it as he turned down the school-wynd, and it came
upon Henders while he was in his garden feeding his ferret. Then he
slapped his legs gleefully, and explained the conceit to Will'um
Byars, who went into the house and thought it over.</p>
<p>There were twelve or twenty little groups of men in the square,
which was lighted by a flare of oil suspended over a cadger's cart.
Now and again a staid young woman passed through the square with a
basket on her arm, and if she had lingered long enough to give them
time, some of the idlers would have addressed her, As it was, they
gazed after her, and then grinned to each other.</p>
<p>"Ay, Sam'l," said two or three young men, as Sam'l joined them
beneath the town clock.</p>
<p>"Ay, Davit," replied Sam'l.</p>
<p>This group was composed of some of the sharpest wits in Thrums,
and it was not to be expected that they would let this opportunity
pass. Perhaps when Sam'l joined them he knew what was in store for
him.</p>
<p>"Was ye lookin' for T'nowhead's Bell, Sam'l?" asked one.</p>
<p>"Or mebbe ye was wantin' the minister?" suggested another, the
same who had walked out twice with Chirsty Duff and not married her
after all.</p>
<p>Sam'l could not think of a good reply at the moment, so he
laughed good-naturedly.</p>
<p>"Ondoobtedly she's a snod bit crittur," said Davit, archly.</p>
<p>"An' michty clever wi' her fingers," added Jamie Deuchars.</p>
<p>"Man, I've thocht o' makkin' up to Bell myself," said Pete Ogle.
"Wid there be ony chance, think ye, Sam'l?"</p>
<p>"I'm thinkin' she widna hae ye for her first, Pete," replied
Sam'l, in one of those happy flashes that come to some men, "but
there's nae sayin' but what she micht tak ye to finish up wi'."</p>
<p>The unexpectedness of this sally startled every one. Though
Sam'l did not set up for a wit, however, like Davit, it was
notorious that he could say a cutting thing once in a way.</p>
<p>"Did ye ever see Bell reddin' up?" asked Pete, recovering from
his overthrow. He was a man who bore no malice.</p>
<p>"It's a sicht," said Sam'l, solemnly.</p>
<p>"Hoo will that be?" asked Jamie Deuchars.</p>
<p>"It's weel worth yer while," said Pete, "to ging atower to the
T'nowhead an' see. Ye'll mind the closed-in beds i' the kitchen?
Ay, weel, they're a fell spoilt crew, T'nowhead's litlins, an' no
that aisy to manage. Th' ither lasses Lisbeth's ha'en had a michty
trouble wi' them. When they war i' the middle o' their reddin up
the bairns wid come tumlin' about the floor, but, sal, I assure ye,
Bell didna fash lang wi' them. Did she, Sam'l?"</p>
<p>"She did not," said Sam'l, dropping into a fine mode of speech
to add emphasis to his remark.</p>
<p>"I'll tell ye what she did," said Pete to the others. "She juist
lifted up the litlins, twa at a time, an' flung them into the
coffin-beds. Syne she snibbit the doors on them, an' keepit them
there till the floor was dry."</p>
<p>"Ay, man, did she so?" said Davit, admiringly.</p>
<p>"I've seen her do't myself," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"There's no a lassie maks better bannocks this side o' Fetter
Lums," continued Pete.</p>
<p>"Her mither tocht her that," said Sam'l; "she was a gran' han'
at the bakin', Kitty Ogilvy."</p>
<p>"I've heard say," remarked Jamie, putting it this way so as not
to tie himself down to anything, "'at Bell's scones is equal to Mag
Lunan's."</p>
<p>"So they are," said Sam'l, almost fiercely.</p>
<p>"I kin she's a neat han' at singein' a hen," said Pete.</p>
<p>"An' wi't a'," said Davit, "she's a snod, canty bit stocky in
her Sabbath claes."</p>
<p>"If onything, thick in the waist," suggested Jamie.</p>
<p>"I dinna see that," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"I d'na care for her hair either," continued Jamie, who was very
nice in his tastes; "something mair yallowchy wid be an
improvement."</p>
<p>"A'body kins," growled Sam'l, "'at black hair's the
bonniest."</p>
<p>The others chuckled.</p>
<p>"Puir Sam'l!" Pete said.</p>
<p>Sam'l, not being certain whether this should be received with a
smile or a frown, opened his mouth wide as a kind of compromise.
This was position one with him for thinking things over.</p>
<p>Few Auld Lichts, as I have said, went the length of choosing a
helpmate for themselves. One day a young man's friends would see
him mending the washing-tub of a maiden's mother. They kept the
joke until Saturday night, and then he learned from them what he
had been after. It dazed him for a time, but in a year or so he
grew accustomed to the idea, and they were then married. With a
little help, he fell in love just like other people.</p>
<p>Sam'l was going the way of the others, but he found it difficult
to come to the point. He only went courting once a week, and he
could never take up the running at the place where he left off the
Saturday before. Thus he had not, so far, made great headway. His
method of making up to Bell had been to drop in at T'nowhead on
Saturday nights and talk with the farmer about the rinderpest.</p>
<p>The farm-kitchen was Bell's testimonial. Its chairs, tables, and
stools were scoured by her to the whiteness of Rob Angus's saw-mill
boards, and the muslin blind on the window was starched like a
child's pinafore. Bell was brave, too, as well as energetic. Once
Thrums had been overrun with thieves. It is now thought that there
may have been only one; but he had the wicked cleverness of a gang.
Such was his repute, that there were weavers who spoke of locking
their doors when they went from home. He was not very skillful,
however, being generally caught, and when they said they knew he
was a robber he gave them their things back and went away. If they
had given him time there is no doubt that he would have gone off
with his plunder. One night he went to T'nowhead, and Bell, who
slept in the kitchen, was awakened by the noise. She knew who it
would be, so she rose and dressed herself, and went to look for him
with a candle. The thief had not known what to do when he got in,
and as it was very lonely he was glad to see Bell. She told him he
ought to be ashamed of himself, and would not let him out by the
door until he had taken off his boots, so as not to soil the
carpet.</p>
<p>On this Saturday evening Sam'l stood his ground in the square,
until by and by he found himself alone. There were other groups
there still, but his circle had melted away. They went separately,
and no one said good-night. Each took himself off slowly, backing
out of the group until he was fairly started.</p>
<p>Sam'l looked about him, and then, seeing that the others had
gone, walked round the town-house into the darkness of the brae
that leads down and then up to the farm of T'nowhead.</p>
<p>To get into the good graces of Lisbeth Fargus you had to know
her ways and humor them. Sam'l, who was a student of women, knew
this, and so, instead of pushing the door open and walking in, he
went through the rather ridiculous ceremony of knocking. Sanders
Elshioner was also aware of this weakness of Lisbeth, but though he
often made up his mind to knock, the absurdity of the thing
prevented his doing so when he reached the door. T'nowhead himself
had never got used to his wife's refined notions, and when any one
knocked he always started to his feet, thinking there must be
something wrong.</p>
<p>Lisbeth came to the door, her expansive figure blocking the way
in.</p>
<p>"Sam'l," she said.</p>
<p>"Lisbeth," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>He shook hands with the farmer's wife, knowing that she liked
it, but only said, "Ay, Bell," to his sweetheart, "Ay, T'nowhead,"
to McQuhatty, and "It's yersel, Sanders," to his rival.</p>
<p>They were all sitting round the fire; T'nowhead with his feet on
the ribs, wondering why he felt so warm, and Bell darned a
stocking, while Lisbeth kept an eye on a goblet full of
potatoes.</p>
<p>"Sit in to the fire, Sam'l," said the farmer, not, however,
making way for him.</p>
<p>"Na, na," said Sam'l, "I'm to bide nae time." Then he sat in to
the fire. His face was turned away from Bell, and when she spoke he
answered her without looking round. Sam'l felt a little anxious.
Sanders Elshioner, who had one leg shorter than the other, but
looked well when sitting, seemed suspiciously at home. He asked
Bell questions out of his own head, which was beyond Sam'l, and
once he said something to her in such a low voice that the others
could not catch it. T'nowhead asked curiously what it was, and
Sanders explained that he had only said, "Ay, Bell, the morn's the
Sabbath." There was nothing startling in this, but Sam'l did not
like it. He began to wonder if he was too late, and had he seen his
opportunity would have told Bell of a nasty rumor, that Sanders
intended to go over to the Free Church if they would make him
kirk-officer.</p>
<p>Sam'l had the good-will of T'nowhead's wife, who liked a polite
man. Sanders did his best, but from want of practice he constantly
made mistakes. To-night, for instance, he wore his hat in the
house, because he did not like to put up his hand and take it off.
T'nowhead had not taken his off either, but that was because he
meant to go out by and by and lock the byre door. It was impossible
to say which of her lovers Bell preferred. The proper course with
an Auld Licht lassie was to prefer the man who proposed to her.</p>
<p>"Yell bide a wee, an' hae something to eat?" Lisbeth asked
Sam'l, with her eyes on the goblet.</p>
<p>"No, I thank ye," said Sam'l, with true gentility.</p>
<p>"Ye'll better?"</p>
<p>"I dinna think it."</p>
<p>"Hoots ay; what's to hender ye?"</p>
<p>"Weel, since ye're sae pressin', I'll bide."</p>
<p>No one asked Sanders to stay. Bell could not, for she was but
the servant, and T'nowhead knew that the kick his wife had given
him meant that he was not to do so either. Sanders whistled to show
that he was not uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Ay, then, I'll be stappin' ower the brae," he said at last.</p>
<p>He did not go, however. There was sufficient pride in him to get
him off his chair, but only slowly, for he had to get accustomed to
the notion of going. At intervals of two or three minutes he
remarked that he must now be going. In the same circumstances Sam'l
would have acted similarly. For a Thrums man it is one of the
hardest things in life to get away from anywhere.</p>
<p>At last Lisbeth saw that something must be done. The potatoes
were burning, and T'nowhead had an invitation on his tongue.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll hae to be movin'," said Sanders, hopelessly, for the
fifth time.</p>
<p>"Guid-nicht to ye, then, Sanders," said Lisbeth. "Gie the door a
fling-to ahent ye."</p>
<p>Sanders, with a mighty effort, pulled himself together. He
looked boldly at Bell, and then took off his hat carefully. Sam'l
saw with misgivings that there was something in it which was not a
handkerchief. It was a paper bag glittering with gold braid, and
contained such an assortment of sweets as lads bought for their
lasses on the Muckle Friday.</p>
<p>"Hae, Bell," said Sanders, handing the bag to Bell in an
off-hand way, as if it were but a trifle. Nevertheless, he was a
little excited, for he went off without saying good-night.</p>
<p>No one spoke. Bell's face was crimson. T'nowhead fidgeted on his
chair, and Lisbeth looked at Sam'l. The weaver was strangely calm
and collected, though he would have liked to know whether this was
a proposal.</p>
<p>"Sit in by to the table, Sam'l," said Lisbeth, trying to look as
if things were as they had been before.</p>
<p>She put a saucerful of butter, salt, and pepper near the fire to
melt, for melted butter is the shoeing-horn that helps over a meal
of potatoes. Sam'l, however, saw what the hour required, and
jumping up, he seized his bonnet.</p>
<p>"Hing the tatties higher up the joist, Lisbeth," he said with
dignity; "I'se be back in ten meenits."</p>
<p>He hurried out of the house, leaving the others looking at each
other.</p>
<p>"What do ye think?" asked Lisbeth.</p>
<p>"I d'na kin," faltered Bell.</p>
<p>"Thae tatties is lang o' comin' to the boil," said
T'nowhead.</p>
<p>In some circles a lover who behaved like Sam'l would have been
suspected of intent upon his rival's life, but neither Bell nor
Lisbeth did the weaver that injustice. In a case of this kind it
does not much matter what T'nowhead thought.</p>
<p>The ten minutes had barely passed when Sam'l was back in the
farm-kitchen. He was too flurried to knock this time, and indeed
Lisbeth did not expect it of him.</p>
<p>"Bell, hae!" he cried, handing his sweetheart a tinsel bag twice
the size of Sanders' gift.</p>
<p>"Losh preserve's!" exclaimed Lisbeth; "I'se warrant there's a
shillin's worth."</p>
<p>"There's a' that, Lisbeth--an' mair," said Sam'l, firmly.</p>
<p>"I thank ye, Sam'l," said Bell, feeling an unwonted elation as
she gazed at the two paper bags in her lap.</p>
<p>"Ye're ower extravegint, Sam'l," Lisbeth said.</p>
<p>"Not at all," said Sam'l; "not at all. But I wouldna advise ye
to eat thae ither anes, Bell--they're second quality."</p>
<p>Bell drew back a step from Sam'l.</p>
<p>"How do ye kin?" asked the farmer, shortly; for he liked
Sanders.</p>
<p>"I speired i' the shop," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>The goblet was placed on a broken plate on the table, with the
saucer beside it, and Sam'l, like the others, helped himself. What
he did was to take potatoes from the pot with his fingers, peel off
their coats, and then dip them into the butter. Lisbeth would have
liked to provide knives and forks, but she knew that beyond a
certain point T'nowhead was master in his own house. As for Sam'l,
he felt victory in his hands, and began to think that he had gone
too far.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sanders, little witting that Sam'l had trumped
his trick, was sauntering along the kirk-wynd with his hat on the
side of his head. Fortunately he did not meet the minister.</p>
<p>The courting of T'nowhead's Bell reached its crisis one Sabbath
about a month after the events above recorded. The minister was in
great force that day, but it is no part of mine to tell how he bore
himself. I was there, and am not likely to forget the scene. It was
a fateful Sabbath for T'nowhead's Bell and her swains, and destined
to be remembered for the painful scandal which they perpetrated in
their passion.</p>
<p>Bell was not in the kirk. There being an infant of six months in
the house, it was a question of either Lisbeth or the lassie's
staying at home with him, and though Lisbeth was unselfish in a
general way, she could not resist the delight of going to church.
She had nine children besides the baby, and being but a woman, it
was the pride of her life to march them into the T'nowhead pew, so
well watched that they dared not disbehave, and so tightly packed
that they could not fall. The congregation looked at that pew, the
mothers enviously, when they sung the lines:--</p>
<blockquote>"Jerusalem like a city is<br>
Compactly built together."</blockquote>
<p>The first half of the service had been gone through on this
particular Sunday without anything remarkable happening. It was at
the end of the psalm which preceded the sermon that Sanders
Elshioner, who sat near the door, lowered his head until it was no
higher than the pews, and in that attitude, looking almost like a
four-footed animal, slipped out of the church. In their eagerness
to be at the sermon, many of the congregation did not notice him,
and those who did, put the matter by in their minds for future
investigation. Sam'l, however, could not take it so coolly. From
his seat in the gallery he saw Sanders disappear and his mind
misgave him. With the true lover's instinct, he understood it all.
Sanders had been struck by the fine turn-out in the T'nowhead pew.
Bell was alone at the farm. What an opportunity to work one's way
up to a proposal. T'nowhead was so overrun with children that such
a chance seldom occurred, except on a Sabbath. Sanders, doubtless,
was off to propose, and he, Sam'l, was left behind.</p>
<p>The suspense was terrible. Sam'l and Sanders had both known all
along that Bell would take the first of the two who asked her. Even
those who thought her proud admitted that she was modest. Bitterly
the weaver repented having waited so long. Now it was too late. In
ten minutes Sanders would be at T'nowhead; in an hour all would be
over. Sam'l rose to his feet in a daze. His mother pulled him down
by the coat-tail, and his father shook him, thinking he was walking
in his sleep. He tottered past them, however, hurried up the aisle,
which was so narrow that Dan'l Ross could only reach his seat by
walking sideways, and was gone before the minister could do more
than stop in the middle of a whirl and gape in horror after
him.</p>
<p>A number of the congregation felt that day the advantage of
sitting in the laft. What was a mystery to those down-stairs was
revealed to them. From the gallery windows they had a fine open
view to the south; and as Sam'l took the common, which was a short
cut, though a steep ascent, to T'nowhead, he was never out of their
line of vision. Sanders was not to be seen, but they guessed
rightly the reason why. Thinking he had ample time, he had gone
round by the main road to save his boots--perhaps a little scared
by what was coming. Sam'l's design was to forestall him by taking
the shorter path over the burn and up the commonty.</p>
<p>It was a race for a wife, and several onlookers in the gallery
braved the minister's displeasure to see who won. Those who favored
Sam'l's suit exultingly saw him leap the stream, while the friends
of Sanders fixed their eyes on the top of the common where it ran
into the road. Sanders must come into sight there, and the one who
reached this point first would get Bell.</p>
<p>As Auld Lichts do not walk abroad on the Sabbath, Sanders would
probably not be delayed. The chances were in his favor. Had it been
any other day in the week, Sam'l might have run. So some of the
congregation in the gallery were thinking, when suddenly they saw
him bend low and then take to his heels. He had caught sight of
Sanders's head bobbing over the hedge that separated the road from
the common, and feared that Sanders might see him. The congregation
who could crane their necks sufficiently saw a black object, which
they guessed to be the carter's hat, crawling along the hedge-top.
For a moment it was motionless, and then it shot ahead. The rivals
had seen each other. It was now a hot race. Sam'l, dissembling no
longer, clattered up the common, becoming smaller and smaller to
the onlookers as he neared the top. More than one person in the
gallery almost rose to their feet in their excitement. Sam'l had
it. No, Sanders was in front. Then the two figures disappeared from
view. They seemed to run into each other at the top of the brae,
and no one could say who was first. The congregation looked at one
another. Some of them perspired. But the minister held on his
course.</p>
<p>Sam'l had just been in time to cut Sanders out. It was the
weaver's saving that Sanders saw this when his rival turned the
corner; for Sam'l was sadly blown. Sanders took in the situation
and gave in at once. The last hundred yards of the distance he
covered at his leisure, and when he arrived at his destination he
did not go in. It was a fine afternoon for the time of year, and he
went round to have a look at the pig, about which T'nowhead was a
little sinfully puffed up.</p>
<p>"Ay," said Sanders, digging his fingers critically into the
grunting animal; "quite so."</p>
<p>"Grumph!" said the pig, getting reluctantly to his feet.</p>
<p>"Ou ay; yes," said Sanders, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Then he sat down on the edge of the sty, and looked long and
silently at an empty bucket. But whether his thoughts were of
T'nowhead's Bell, whom he had lost forever, or of the food the
farmer fed his pig on, is not known.</p>
<p>"Lord preserve's! Are ye no at the kirk?" cried Bell, nearly
dropping the baby as Sam'l broke into the room.</p>
<p>"Bell!" cried Sam'l.</p>
<p>Then T'nowhead's Bell knew that her hour had come.</p>
<p>"Sam'l," she faltered.</p>
<p>"Will ye hae's, Bell?" demanded Sam'l, glaring at her
sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Ay," answered Bell.</p>
<p>Sam'l fell into a chair.</p>
<p>"Bring's a drink o' water, Bell," he said.</p>
<p>But Bell thought the occasion required milk, and there was none
in the kitchen. She went out to the byre, still with the baby in
her arms, and saw Sanders Elshioner sitting gloomily on the
pig-sty.</p>
<p>"Weel, Bell," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"I thocht ye'd been at the kirk, Sanders," said Bell.</p>
<p>Then there was a silence between them.</p>
<p>"Has Sam'l speired ye, Bell?" asked Sanders, stolidly.</p>
<p>"Ay," said Bell again, and this time there was a tear in her
eye. Sanders was little better than an "orra man," and Sam'l was a
weaver, and yet--</p>
<p>But it was too late now. Sanders gave the pig a vicious poke
with a stick, and when it had ceased to grunt, Bell was back in the
kitchen. She had forgotten about the milk, however, and Sam'l only
got water after all.</p>
<p>In after days, when the story of Bell's wooing was told, there
were some who held that the circumstances would have almost
justified the lassie in giving Sam'l the go-by. But these perhaps
forgot that her other lover was in the same predicament as the
accepted one--that, of the two, indeed, he was the more to blame,
for he set off to T'nowhead on the Sabbath of his own accord, while
Sam'l only ran after him. And then there is no one to say for
certain whether Bell heard of her suitors' delinquencies until
Lisbeth's return from the kirk. Sam'l could never remember whether
he told her, and Bell was not sure whether, if he did, she took it
in. Sanders was greatly in demand for weeks after to tell what he
knew of the affair, but though he was twice asked to tea to the
manse among the trees, and subjected thereafter to ministerial
cross-examinations, this is all he told. He remained at the pigsty
until Sam'l left the farm, when he joined him at the top of the
brae, and they went home together.</p>
<p>"It's yersel, Sanders," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"It is so, Sam'l," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"Very cauld," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"Blawy," assented Sanders.</p>
<p>After a pause--</p>
<p>"Sam'l," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"Ay."</p>
<p>"I'm hearin' yer to be mairit."</p>
<p>"Ay."</p>
<p>"Weel, Sam'l, she's a snod bit lassie."</p>
<p>"Thank ye," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"I had ance a kin' o' notion o' Bell mysel," continued
Sanders.</p>
<p>"Ye had?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sam'l; but I thocht better o't."</p>
<p>"Hoo d'ye mean?" asked Sam'l, a little anxiously.</p>
<p>"Weel, Sam'l, mairitch is a terrible responsibeelity."</p>
<p>"It is so," said Sam'l, wincing.</p>
<p>"An' no the thing to take up withoot conseederation."</p>
<p>"But it's a blessed and honorable state, Sanders; ye've heard
the minister on't."</p>
<p>"They say," continued the relentless Sanders, "'at the minister
doesna get on sair wi' the wife himsel."</p>
<p>"So they do," cried Sam'l, with a sinking at the heart.</p>
<p>"I've been telt," Sanders went on, "'at gin you can get the
upper han' o' the wife for awhile at first, there's the mair chance
o' a harmonious exeestence."</p>
<p>"Bell's no the lassie," said Sam'l, appealingly, "to thwart her
man."</p>
<p>Sanders smiled.</p>
<p>"D'ye think she is, Sanders?"</p>
<p>"Weel, Sam'l, I d'na want to fluster ye, but she's been ower
lang wi' Lisbeth Fargus no to hae learnt her ways. An' a'body kins
what a life T'nowhead has wi' her."</p>
<p>"Guid sake, Sanders, hoo did ye no speak o' this afoore?"</p>
<p>"I thocht ye kent o't, Sam'l."</p>
<p>They had now reached the square, and the U.P. kirk was coming
out. The Auld Licht kirk would be half an hour yet.</p>
<p>"But, Sanders," said Sam'l, brightening up, "ye was on yer wy to
spier her yersel."</p>
<p>"I was, Sam'l," said Sanders, "and I canna but be thankfu' ye
was ower quick for's."</p>
<p>"Gin't hadna been for you," said Sam'l, "I wid never hae thocht
o't."</p>
<p>"I'm sayin' naething agin Bell," pursued the other, "but, man
Sam'l, a body should be mair deleeberate in a thing o' the
kind."</p>
<p>"It was michty hurried," said Sam'l, wofully.</p>
<p>"It's a serious thing to spier a lassie," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"It's an awfu' thing," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"But we'll hope for the best," added Sanders, in a hopeless,
voice.</p>
<p>They were close to the Tenements now, and Sam'l looked as if he
were on his way to be hanged.</p>
<p>"Sam'l?"</p>
<p>"Ay, Sanders."</p>
<p>"Did ye--did ye kiss her, Sam'l?"</p>
<p>"Na."</p>
<p>"Hoo?"</p>
<p>"There's was varra little time, Sanders."</p>
<p>"Half an 'oor," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"Was there? Man Sanders, to tell ye the truth, I never thocht
o't."</p>
<p>Then the soul of Sanders Elshioner was filled with contempt for
Sam'l Dickie.</p>
<p>The scandal blew over. At first it was expected that the
minister would interfere to prevent the union, but beyond
intimating from the pulpit that the souls of Sabbath-breakers were
beyond praying for, and then praying for Sam'l and Sanders at great
length, with a word thrown in for Bell, he let things take their
course. Some said it was because he was always frightened lest his
young men should intermarry with other denominations, but Sanders
explained it differently to Sam'l.</p>
<p>"I hav'na a word to say agin the minister," he said; "they're
gran' prayers, but Sam'l, he's a mairit man himsel."</p>
<p>"He's a' the better for that, Sanders, isna he?"</p>
<p>"Do ye no see," asked Sanders, compassionately, "'at he's tryin'
to mak the best o't?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Sanders, man!" said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"Cheer up, Sam'l," said Sanders; "it'll sune be ower."</p>
<p>Their having been rival suitors had not interfered with their
friendship. On the contrary, while they had hitherto been mere
acquaintances, they became inseparables as the wedding-day drew
near. It was noticed that they had much to say to each other, and
that when they could not get a room to themselves they wandered
about together in the churchyard. When Sam'l had anything to tell
Bell, he sent Sanders to tell it, and Sanders did as he was bid.
There was nothing that he would not have done for Sam'l.</p>
<p>The more obliging Sanders was, however, the sadder Sam'l grew.
He never laughed now on Saturdays, and sometimes his loom was
silent half the day. Sam'l felt that Sanders's was the kindness of
a friend for a dying man.</p>
<p>It was to be a penny wedding, and Lisbeth Fargus said it was
delicacy that made Sam'l superintend the fitting-up of the barn by
deputy. Once he came to see it in person, but he looked so ill that
Sanders had to see him home. This was on the Thursday afternoon,
and the wedding was fixed for Friday.</p>
<p>"Sanders, Sanders," said Sam'l, in a voice strangely unlike his
own, "it'll a' be ower by this time the morn."</p>
<p>"It will," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"If I had only kent her langer," continued Sam'l.</p>
<p>"It wid hae been safer," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"Did ye see the yallow floor in Bell's bonnet?" asked the
accepted swain.</p>
<p>"Ay," said Sanders, reluctantly.</p>
<p>"I'm dootin'--I'm sair dootin' she's but a flichty,
licht-hearted crittur, after a'."</p>
<p>"I had ay my suspeecions o't," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"Ye hae kent her langer than me," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sanders, "but there's nae gettin' at the heart o'
women. Man Sam'l, they're desperate cunnin'."</p>
<p>"I'm dootin't; I'm sair dootin't."</p>
<p>"It'll be a warnin' to ye, Sam'l, no to be in sic a hurry i' the
futur," said Sanders.</p>
<p>Sam'l groaned.</p>
<p>"Ye'll be gaein up to the manse to arrange wi' the minister the
morn's mornin'," continued Sanders, in a subdued voice.</p>
<p>Sam'l looked wistfully at his friend.</p>
<p>"I canna do't, Sanders," he said, "I canna do't."</p>
<p>"Ye maun," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"It's aisy to speak," retorted Sam'l, bitterly.</p>
<p>"We have a' oor troubles, Sam'l," said Sanders, soothingly, "an'
every man maun bear his ain burdens. Johnny Davie's wife's dead,
an' he's no repinin'."</p>
<p>"Ay," said Sam'l, "but a death's no a mairitch. We hae haen
deaths in our family, too."</p>
<p>"It may a' be for the best," added Sanders, "an' there wid be a
michty talk i' the hale country-side gin ye didna ging to the
minister like a man."</p>
<p>"I maun hae langer to think o't," said Sam'l.</p>
<p>"Bell's mairitch is the morn," said Sanders, decisively.</p>
<p>Sam'l glanced up with a wild look in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Sanders!" he cried.</p>
<p>"Sam'l!"</p>
<p>"Ye hae been a guid friend to me, Sanders, in this sair
affliction."</p>
<p>"Nothing ava," said Sanders; "dount mention't."</p>
<p>"But, Sanders, ye canna deny but what your rinnin oot o' the
kirk that awfu' day was at the bottom o't a'."</p>
<p>"It was so," said Sanders, bravely.</p>
<p>"An' ye used to be fond o' Bell, Sanders."</p>
<p>"I dinna deny't."</p>
<p>"Sanders, laddie," said Sam'l, bending forward and speaking in a
wheedling voice, "I aye thocht it was you she likit."</p>
<p>"I had some sic idea mysel," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"Sanders, I canna think to pairt twa fowk sae weel suited to ane
anither as you an' Bell."</p>
<p>"Canna ye, Sam'l?"</p>
<p>"She wid make ye a guid wife, Sanders. I hae studied her weel,
and she's a thrifty, douce, clever lassie. Sanders, there's no the
like o' her. Mony a time, Sanders, I hae said to mysel, There's a
lass ony man micht be prood to tak. A'body says the same, Sanders.
There's nae risk ava, man; nane to speak o'. Tak her, laddie, tak
her, Sanders, it's a grand chance, Sanders. She's yours for the
speirin. I'll gie her up, Sanders."</p>
<p>"Will ye, though?" said Sanders.</p>
<p>"What d'ye think?" asked Sam'l.</p>
<p>"If ye wid rayther," said Sanders, politely.</p>
<p>"There's my han' on't," said Sam'l. "Bless ye, Sanders; ye've
been a true frien' to me."</p>
<p>Then they shook hands for the first time in their lives; and
soon afterward Sanders struck up the brae to T'nowhead.</p>
<p>Next morning Sanders Elshioner, who had been very busy the night
before, put on his Sabbath clothes and strolled up to the
manse.</p>
<p>"But--but where is Sam'l?" asked the minister. "I must see
himself."</p>
<p>"It's a new arrangement," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Sanders?"</p>
<p>"Bell's to marry me," explained Sanders.</p>
<p>"But--- but what does Sam'l say?"</p>
<p>"He's willin'," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"And Bell?"</p>
<p>"She's willin', too. She prefers it."</p>
<p>"It is unusual," said the minister.</p>
<p>"It's a' richt," said Sanders.</p>
<p>"Well, you know best," said the minister.</p>
<p>"You see, the hoose was taen, at ony rate," continued Sanders.
"An' I'll juist ging in til't instead o' Sam'l."</p>
<p>"Quite so."</p>
<p>"An" I cudna think to disappoint the lassie."</p>
<p>"Your sentiments do you credit, Sanders," said the minister;
"but I hope you do not enter upon the blessed state of matrimony
without full consideration of its responsibilities. It is a serious
business, marriage."</p>
<p>"It's a' that," said Sanders; "but I'm willin' to stan' the
risk."</p>
<p>So, as soon as it could be done, Sanders Elshioner took to wife
T'nowhead's Bell, and I remember seeing Sam'l Dickie trying to
dance at the penny wedding.</p>
<p>Years afterward it was said in Thrums that Sam'l had treated
Bell badly, but he was never sure about it himself.</p>
<p>"It was a near thing--a michty near thing," he admitted in the
square.</p>
<p>"They say," some other weaver would remark, "'at it was you Bell
liked best."</p>
<p>"I d'na kin," Sam'l would reply, "but there's nae doot the
lassie was fell fond o' me. Ou, a mere passin' fancy's ye micht
say."</p>

<center><b>JESS LEFT ALONE</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'A Window in Thrums'</center>
<br>
<p>There may be a few who care to know how the lives of Jess and
Hendry ended. Leeby died in the back end of the year I have been
speaking of, and as I was snowed up in the school-house at the
time, I heard the news from Gavin Birse too late to attend her
funeral. She got her death on the commonty one day of sudden rain,
when she had run out to bring in her washing, for the terrible cold
she woke with next morning carried her off very quickly. Leeby did
not blame Jamie for not coming to her, nor did I, for I knew that
even in the presence of death the poor must drag their chains. He
never got Hendry's letter with the news, and we know now that he
was already in the hands of her who played the devil with his life.
Before the spring came he had been lost to Jess.</p>
<p>"Them 'at has got sae mony blessin's mair than the generality,"
Hendry said to me one day, when Craigiebuckle had given me a lift
into Thrums, "has nae shame if they would pray aye for mair. The
Lord has gi'en this hoose sae muckle, 'at to pray for mair looks
like no bein' thankfu' for what we've got. Ay, but I canna help
prayin' to Him 'at in His great mercy he'll tak Jess afore me. Noo
'at Leeby's gone, an' Jamie never lets us hear frae him, I canna
gulp doon the thocht o' Jess bein' left alane."</p>
<p>This was a prayer that Hendry may be pardoned for having so
often in his heart, though God did not think fit to grant it. In
Thrums, when a weaver died, his women-folk had to take his seat at
the loom, and those who, by reason of infirmities, could not do so,
went to a place, the name of which, I thank God, I am not compelled
to write in this chapter. I could not, even at this day, have told
any episode in the life of Jess had it ended in the poor house.</p>
<p>Hendry would probably have recovered from the fever had not this
terrible dread darkened his intellect when he was still prostrate.
He was lying in the kitchen when I saw him last in life, and his
parting words must be sadder to the reader than they were to
me.</p>
<p>"Ay, richt ye are," he said, in a voice that had become a
child's; "I hae muckle, muckle to be thankfu' for, an' no the least
is 'at baith me an' Jess has aye belonged to a bural society. We
hae nae cause to be anxious aboot a' thing bein' dune respectable
aince we're gone. It was Jess 'at insisted on oor joinin': a' the
wisest things I ever did I was put up to by her."</p>
<p>I parted from Hendry, cheered by the doctor's report, but the
old weaver died a few days afterward. His end was mournful, yet I
can recall it now as the not unworthy close of a good man's life.
One night poor worn Jess had been helped ben into the room, Tibbie
Birse having undertaken to sit up with Hendry.</p>
<p>Jess slept for the first time for many days, and as the night
was dying Tibbie fell asleep too. Hendry had been better than
usual, lying quietly, Tibbie said, and the fever was gone. About
three o'clock Tibbie woke and rose to mend the fire. Then she saw
that Hendry was not in his bed.</p>
<p>Tibbie went ben the house in her stocking soles, but Jess heard
her.</p>
<p>"What is't, Tibbie?" she asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>"Ou, it's no naething," Tibbie said; "he's lyin' rale
quiet."</p>
<p>Then she went up to the attic. Hendry was not in the house.</p>
<p>She opened the door gently and stole out. It was not snowing,
but there had been a heavy fall two days before, and the night was
windy. A tearing gale had blown the upper part of the brae clear,
and from T'nowhead's fields the snow was rising like smoke. Tibbie
ran to the farm and woke up T'nowhead.</p>
<p>For an hour they looked in vain for Hendry. At last some one
asked who was working in Elshioner's shop all night. This was the
long earthen-floored room in which Hendry's loom stood with three
others.</p>
<p>"It'll be Sanders Whamond likely," T'nowhead said, and the other
men nodded.</p>
<p>But it happened that T'nowhead's Bell, who had flung on a
wrapper, and hastened across to sit with Jess, heard of the light
in Elshioner's shop.</p>
<p>"It's Hendry," she cried; and then every one moved toward the
workshop.</p>
<p>The light at the diminutive, darn-covered window was pale and
dim, but Bell, who was at the house first, could make the most of a
cruizey's glimmer.</p>
<p>"It's him," she said; and then, with swelling throat, she ran
back to Jess.</p>
<p>The door of the workshop was wide open, held against the wall by
the wind. T'nowhead and the others went in. The cruizey stood on
the little window. Hendry's back was to the door, and he was
leaning forward on the silent loom. He had been dead for some time,
but his fellow-workers saw that he must have weaved for nearly an
hour.</p>
<p>So it came about that for the last few months of her pilgrimage
Jess was left alone. Yet I may not say that she was alone. Jamie,
who should have been with her, was undergoing his own ordeal far
away; where, we did not now even know. But though the poorhouse
stands in Thrums, where all may see it, the neighbors did not think
only of themselves.</p>
<p>Than Tammas Haggart there can scarcely have been a poorer man,
but Tammas was the first to come forward with offer of help. To the
day of Jess's death he did not once fail to carry her water to her
in the morning, and the luxuriously living men of Thrums in these
present days of pumps at every corner, can hardly realize what that
meant. Often there were lines of people at the well by three
o'clock in the morning, and each had to wait his turn. Tammas
filled his own pitcher and pan, and then had to take his place at
the end of the line with Jess's pitcher and pan, to wait his turn
again. His own house was in the Tenements, far from the brae in
winter time, but he always said to Jess it was "naething ava."</p>
<p>Every Saturday old Robbie Angus sent a bag of sticks and
shavings from the sawmill by his little son Rob, who was afterward
to become a man for speaking about at nights. Of all the friends
that Jess and Hendry had, T'nowhead was the ablest to help, and the
sweetest memory I have of the farmer and his wife is the delicate
way they offered it. You who read will see Jess wince at the offer
of charity. But the poor have fine feelings beneath the grime, as
you will discover if you care to look for them; and when Jess said
she would bake if anyone would buy, you would wonder to hear how
many kindly folk came to her door for scones.</p>
<p>She had the house to herself at nights, but Tibbie Birse was
with her early in the morning, and other neighbors dropped in. Not
for long did she have to wait the summons to the better home.</p>
<p>"Na," she said to the minister, who has told me that he was a
better man from knowing her, "my thocht is no nane set on the
vanities o' the world noo. I kenna hoo I could ever hae haen sic an
ambeetion to hae thae stuff-bottomed chairs."</p>
<p>I have tried to keep away from Jamie, whom the neighbors
sometimes upbraided in her presence. It is of him you who read
would like to hear, and I cannot pretend that Jess did not sit at
her window looking for him.</p>
<p>"Even when she was bakin'," Tibbie told me, "she aye had an eye
on the brae. If Jamie had come at ony time when it was licht she
would hae seen 'im as sune as he turned the corner."</p>
<p>"If he ever comes back, the sacket" (rascal), T'nowhead said to
Jess, "we'll show 'im the door gey quick."</p>
<p>Jess just looked, and all the women knew how she would take
Jamie to her arms.</p>
<p>We did not know of the London woman then, and Jess never knew of
her. Jamie's mother never for an hour allowed that he had become
anything but the loving laddie of his youth.</p>
<p>"I ken 'im ower weel," she always said, "my ain Jamie."</p>
<p>Toward the end she was sure he was dead. I do not know when she
first made up her mind to this, nor whether it was not merely a
phrase for those who wanted to discuss him with her. I know that
she still sat at the window looking at the elbow of the brae.</p>
<p>The minister was with her when she died. She was in her chair,
and he asked her, as was his custom, if there was any particular
chapter which she would like him to read. Since her husband's death
she had always asked for the fourteenth of John, "Hendry's
chapter," as it is still called among a very few old people in
Thrums. This time she asked him to read the sixteenth chapter of
Genesis.</p>
<p>"When I came to the thirteenth verse," the minister told me,
"'And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God
seest me,' she covered her face with her two hands, and said,
'Joey's text, Joey's text. Oh, but I grudged ye sair, Joey.'"</p>
<p>"I shut the book," the minister said, "when I came to the end of
the chapter, and then I saw that she was dead. It is my belief that
her heart broke one-and-twenty years ago."</p>

<br>
<center>From 'The Little Minister': by permission of the American
Publishers' Corporation.</center>
<br>
<p>One may gossip in a glen on Sabbaths, though not in a town,
without losing his character, and I used to await the return of my
neighbor, the farmer of Waster Lunny, and of Birse, the Glen
Quharity post, at the end of the school-house path. Waster Lunny
was a man whose care in his leisure hours was to keep from his wife
his great pride in her. His horse, Catlaw, on the other hand, he
told outright what he thought of it, praising it to its face and
blackguarding it as it deserved, and I have seen him, when
completely baffled by the brute, sit down before it on a stone and
thus harangue:--"You think you're clever, Catlaw, my lass, but
you're mista'en. You're a thrawn limmer, that's what you are. You
think you have blood in you. You ha'e blood! Gae awa, and dinna
blether. I tell you what, Catlaw, I met a man yestreen that kent
your mither, and he says she was a feikie,<a name=
"FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3">[3]</a> fushionless besom.
What do you say to that?"</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor3">[3]</a>
Feikie, over-particular.</blockquote>
<p>As for the post, I will say no more of him than that his bitter
topic was the unreasonableness of humanity, which treated him
graciously when he had a letter for it, but scowled at him when he
had none, "aye implying that I ha'e a letter, but keep it
back."</p>
<p>On the Sabbath evening after the riot, I stood at the usual
place awaiting my friends, and saw before they reached me that they
had something untoward to tell. The farmer, his wife, and three
children, holding each other's hands, stretched across the road.
Birse was a little behind, but a conversation was being kept up by
shouting. All were walking the Sabbath pace, and the family having
started half a minute in advance, the post had not yet made up on
them.</p>
<p>"It's sitting to snaw," Waster Lunny said, drawing near, and
just as I was to reply, "It is so," Silva slipped in the words
before me.</p>
<p>"You wasna at the kirk," was Elspeth's salutation. I had been at
the glen church, but did not contradict her, for it is Established,
and so neither here nor there. I was anxious, too, to know what
their long faces meant, and therefore asked at once,--"Was Mr.
Dishart on the riot?"</p>
<p>"Forenoon, ay; afternoon, no," replied Waster Lunny, walking
round his wife to get nearer me. "Dominie, a queery thing happened
in the kirk this day, sic as--"</p>
<p>"Waster Lunny," interrupted Elspeth sharply, "have you on your
Sabbath shoon or have you no on your Sabbath shoon?"</p>
<p>"Guid care you took I should ha'e the dagont oncanny things on,"
retorted the farmer.</p>
<p>"Keep out o' the gutter, then," said Elspeth, "on the Lord's
day."</p>
<p>"Him," said her man, "that is forced by a foolish woman to wear
genteel 'lastic-sided boots canna forget them until he takes them
aff. Whaur's the extra reverence in wearing shoon twa sizes ower
sma'?"</p>
<p>"It mayna be mair reverent," suggested Birse, to whom Elspeth's
kitchen was a pleasant place, "but it's grand, and you canna expect
to be baith grand and comfortable."</p>
<p>I reminded them that they were speaking of Mr. Dishart.</p>
<p>"We was saying," began the post briskly, "that--"</p>
<p>"It was me that was saying it," said Waster Lunny. "So,
Dominie--"</p>
<p>"Haud your gabs, baith o' you," interrupted Elspeth. "You've
been roaring the story to one another till you're hoarse."</p>
<p>"In the forenoon," Waster Lunny went on determinedly, "Mr.
Dishart preached on the riot, and fine he was. Oh, dominie, you
should hae heard him ladling it on to Lang Tammas, no by name, but
in sic a way that there was no mistaking wha he was preaching at.
Sal! oh, losh! Tammas got it strong."</p>
<p>"But he's dull in the uptake," broke in the post, "by what I
expected. I spoke to him after the sermon, and I says, just to see
if he was properly humbled:--'Ay, Tammas,' I says, 'them that
discourse was preached against winna think themselves seven-feet
men for a while again.' 'Ay, Birse,' he answers, 'and glad I am to
hear you admit it, for he had you in his eye.' I was fair scunnered
at Tammas the day."</p>
<p>"Mr. Dishart was preaching at the whole clan-jamfray o' you,"
said Elspeth.</p>
<p>"Maybe he was," said her husband, leering; "but you needna cast
it at us, for my certie, if the men got it frae him in the
forenoon, the women got it in the afternoon."</p>
<p>"He redd them up most michty," said the post. "Thae was his very
words or something like them:--'Adam,' says he, 'was an erring man,
but aside Eve he was respectable.'"</p>
<p>"Ay, but it wasna a' women he meant," Elspeth explained, "for
when he said that, he pointed his finger direct at T'nowhead's
lassie, and I hope it'll do her good."</p>
<p>"But, I wonder," I said, "that Mr. Dishart chose such a subject
to-day. I thought he would be on the riot at both services."</p>
<p>"You'll wonder mair," said Elspeth, "when you hear what happened
afore he began the afternoon sermon. But I canna get in a word wi'
that man o' mine."</p>
<p>"We've been speaking about it," said Birse, "ever since we left
the kirk door. Tod, we've been sawing it like seed a' alang the
glen."</p>
<p>"And we meant to tell you about it at once," said Waster Lunny;
"but there's aye so muckle to say about a minister. Dagont, to hae
ane keeps a body out o' languor. Aye, but this breaks the drum.
Dominie, either Mr. Dishart wasna weel or he was in the devil's
grip."</p>
<p>This startled me, for the farmer was looking serious.</p>
<p>"He was weel eneuch," said Birse, "for a heap o' fowk spiered at
Jean if he had ta'en his porridge as usual, and she admitted he
had. But the lassie was skeered hersel', and said it was a mercy
Mrs. Dishart wasna in the kirk."</p>
<p>"Why was she not there?" I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Ou, he winna let her out in sic weather."</p>
<p>"I wish you would tell me what happened," I said to Elspeth.</p>
<p>"So I will," she answered, "if Waster Lunny would haud his
wheest for a minute. You see the afternoon diet began in the
ordinary way, and a' was richt until we came to the sermon. 'You
will find my text,' he says, in his piercing voice, 'in the eighth
chapter of Ezra.'"</p>
<p>"And at thae words," said Waster Lunny, "my heart gae a loup,
for Ezra is an unca ill book to find; ay, and so is Ruth."</p>
<p>"I kent the books o' the Bible by heart," said Elspeth,
scornfully, "when I was a sax-year-auld."</p>
<p>"So did I," said Waster Lunny, "and I ken them yet, except when
I'm hurried. When Mr. Dishart gave out Ezra he a sort o' keeked
round the kirk to find out if he had puzzled onybody, and so there
was a kind o' a competition among the congregation wha would lay
hand on it first. That was what doited me. Ay, there was Ruth when
she wasna wanted, but Ezra, dagont, it looked as if Ezra had jumped
clean out o' the Bible."</p>
<p>"You wasna the only distressed crittur," said his wife. "I was
ashamed to see Eppie McLaren looking up the order o' the books at
the beginning o' the Bible."</p>
<p>"Tibbie Birse was even mair brazen," said the post, "for the sly
cuttie opened at Kings and pretended it was Ezra."</p>
<p>"None o' thae things would I do," said Waster Lunny, "and sal, I
dauredna, for Davit Lunan was glowering ower my shuther. Ay, you
may scowl at me, Elspeth Proctor, but as far back as I can mind
Ezra has done me. Mony a time afore I start for the kirk I take my
Bible to a quiet place and look Ezra up. In the very pew I says
canny to mysel', 'Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job,' the which should be
a help, but the moment the minister gi'es out that awfu' book, away
goes Ezra like the Egyptian."</p>
<p>"And you after her," said Elspeth, "like the weavers that
wouldna fecht. You make a windmill of your Bible."</p>
<p>"Oh, I winna admit I'm beat. Never mind, there's queer things in
the world forby Ezra. How is cripples aye so puffed up mair than
other folk? How does flour-bread aye fall on the buttered
side?"</p>
<p>"I will mind," Elspeth said, "for I was terrified the minister
would admonish you frae the pulpit."</p>
<p>"He couldna hae done that, for was he no baffled to find Ezra
himsel'?"</p>
<p>"Him no find Ezra!" cried Elspeth. "I hae telled you a dozen
times he found it as easy as you could yoke a horse."</p>
<p>"The thing can be explained in no other way," said her husband
doggedly; "if he was weel and in sound mind."</p>
<p>"Maybe the dominie can clear it up," suggested the post, "him
being a scholar."</p>
<p>"Then tell me what happened," I asked.</p>
<p>"Man, hae we no telled you?" Birse said. "I thocht we had."</p>
<p>"It was a terrible scene," said Elspeth, giving her husband a
shove. "As I said, Mr. Dishart gave out Ezra eighth. Weel, I turned
it up in a jiffy, and syne looked cautiously to see how Eppie
McLaren was getting on. Just at that minute I heard a groan frae
the pulpit. It didna stop short o' a groan. Ay, you may be sure I
looked quick at the minister, and there I saw a sicht that would
hae made the grandest gape. His face was as white as a baker's, and
he had a sort of fallen against the back o' the pulpit, staring
demented-like at his open Bible."</p>
<p>"And I saw him," said Birse, "put up his hand atween him and the
Book, as if he thocht it was to jump at him."</p>
<p>"Twice," said Elspeth, "he tried to speak, and twice he let the
words fall."</p>
<p>"That," said Waster Lunny, "the whole congregation admits, but I
didna see it mysel', for a' this time you may picture me hunting
savage-like for Ezra. I thocht the minister was waiting till I
found it."</p>
<p>"Hendry Munn," said Birse, "stood upon one leg, wondering
whether he should run to the session-house for a glass of
water."</p>
<p>"But by that time," said Elspeth, "the fit had left Mr. Dishart,
or rather it had ta'en a new turn. He grew red, and it's gospel
that he stamped his foot."</p>
<p>"He had the face of one using bad words," said the post. "He
didna swear, of course, but that was the face he had on."</p>
<p>"I missed it," said Waster Lunny, "for I was in full cry after
Ezra, with the sweat running down my face."</p>
<p>"But the most astounding thing has yet to be telled," went on
Elspeth. "The minister shook himsel' like one wakening frae a nasty
dream, and he cries in a voice of thunder, just as if he was
shaking his fist at somebody--"</p>
<p>"He cries," Birse interposed, cleverly, "he cries, 'You will
find the text in Genesis, chapter three, verse six.'"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Elspeth, "first he gave out one text, and then he
gave out another, being the most amazing thing to my mind that ever
happened in the town of Thrums. What will our children's children
think o't? I wouldna ha'e missed it for a pound note."</p>
<p>"Nor me," said Waster Lunny, "though I only got the tail o't.
Dominie, no sooner had he said Genesis third and sixth, than I laid
my finger on Ezra. Was it no provoking? Onybody can turn up
Genesis, but it needs an able-bodied man to find Ezra."</p>
<p>"He preached on the Fall," Elspeth said, "for an hour and
twenty-five minutes, but powerful though he was I would rather he
had telled us what made him gie the go-by to Ezra."</p>
<p>"All I can say," said Waster Lunny, "is that I never heard him
mair awe-inspiring. Whaur has he got sic a knowledge of women? He
riddled them, he fair riddled them, till I was ashamed o' being
married."</p>
<p>"It's easy kent whaur he got his knowledge of women," Birse
explained, "it's a' in the original Hebrew. You can howk ony mortal
thing out o' the original Hebrew, the which all ministers hae at
their finger ends. What else makes them ken to jump a verse now and
then when giving out a psalm?"</p>
<p>"It wasna women like me he denounced," Elspeth insisted, "but
young lassies that leads men astray wi' their abominable wheedling
ways."</p>
<p>"Tod," said her husband, "if they try their hands on Mr. Dishart
they'll meet their match."</p>
<p>"They will," chuckled the post. "The Hebrew's a grand thing,
though teuch, I'm telled, michty teuch."</p>
<p>"His sublimest burst," Waster Lunny came back to tell me, "was
about the beauty o' the soul being everything and the beauty o' the
face no worth a snuff. What a scorn he has for bonny faces and toom
souls! I dinna deny but what a bonny face fell takes me, but Mr.
Dishart wouldna gi'e a blade o' grass for't. Ay, and I used to
think that in their foolishness about women there was dagont little
differ atween the unlearned and the highly edicated."</p>

<center><b>THE MUTUAL DISCOVERY</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'The Little Minister': by permission of the American
Publishers' Corporation</center>
<br>
<p>A young man thinks that he alone of mortals is impervious to
love, and so the discovery that he is in it suddenly alters his
views of his own mechanism. It is thus not unlike a rap on the
funny-bone. Did Gavin make this discovery when the Egyptian left
him? Apparently he only came to the brink of it and stood blind. He
had driven her from him for ever, and his sense of loss was so
acute that his soul cried out for the cure rather than for the name
of the malady.</p>
<p>In time he would have realized what had happened, but time was
denied him, for just as he was starting for the mudhouse Babbie
saved his dignity by returning to him.... She looked up surprised,
or seemingly surprised, to find him still there.</p>
<p>"I thought you had gone away long ago," she said stiffly.</p>
<p>"Otherwise," asked Gavin the dejected, "you would not have came
back to the well?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"I am very sorry. Had you waited another moment I should have
been gone."</p>
<p>This was said in apology, but the willful Egyptian chose to
change its meaning.</p>
<p>"You have no right to blame me for disturbing you," she declared
with warmth.</p>
<p>"I did not. I only--"</p>
<p>"You could have been a mile away by this time. Nanny wanted more
water."</p>
<p>Babbie scrutinized the minister sharply as she made this
statement. Surely her conscience troubled her, for on his not
answering immediately she said, "Do you presume to disbelieve me?
What could have made me return except to fill the pans again?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Gavin admitted eagerly, "and I assure you---"</p>
<p>Babbie should have been grateful to his denseness, but it merely
set her mind at rest.</p>
<p>"Say anything against me you choose," she told him. "Say it as
brutally as you like, for I won't listen."</p>
<p>She stopped to hear his response to that, and she looked so cold
that it almost froze on Gavin's lips.</p>
<p>"I had no right," he said dolefully, "to speak to you as I
did."</p>
<p>"You had not," answered the proud Egyptian. She was looking away
from him to show that his repentance was not even interesting to
her. However, she had forgotten already not to listen....</p>
<p>She was very near him, and the tears had not yet dried on her
eyes. They were laughing eyes, eyes in distress, imploring eyes.
Her pale face, smiling, sad, dimpled yet entreating forgiveness,
was the one prominent thing in the world to him just then. He
wanted to kiss her. He would do it as soon as her eyes rested on
his, but she continued without regarding him.</p>
<p>"How mean that sounds! Oh, if I were a man I would wish to be
everything that I am not, and nothing that I am. I would scorn to
be a liar, I would choose to be open in all things, I would try to
fight the world honestly. But I am only a woman, and so--well, that
is the kind of man I would like to marry."</p>
<p>"A minister may be all these things," said Gavin
breathlessly.</p>
<p>"The man I could love," Babbie went on, not heeding him, almost
forgetting that he was there, "must not spend his days in idleness
as the men I know do."</p>
<p>"I do not."</p>
<p>"He must be brave, no mere worker among others, but a leader of
men."</p>
<p>"All ministers are."</p>
<p>"Who makes his influence felt."</p>
<p>"Assuredly."</p>
<p>"And takes the side of the weak against the strong, even though
the strong be in the right."</p>
<p>"Always my tendency."</p>
<p>"A man who has a mind of his own, and having once made it up
stands to it in defiance even of--"</p>
<p>"Of his session."</p>
<p>"Of the world. He must understand me."</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"And be my master."</p>
<p>"It is his lawful position in the house."</p>
<p>"He must not yield to my coaxing or tempers."</p>
<p>"It would be weakness."</p>
<p>"But compel me to do his bidding; yes, even thrash me if-"</p>
<p>"If you won't listen to reason. Babbie," cried Gavin, "I am that
man!"</p>
<p>Here the inventory abruptly ended, and these two people found
themselves staring at each other, as if of a sudden they had heard
something dreadful. I do not know how long they stood thus
motionless and horrified. I cannot tell even which stirred first.
All I know is that almost simultaneously they turned from each
other and hurried out of the wood in opposite directions.</p>

<center><b>LOST ILLUSIONS</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Sentimental Tommy'</center>
<br>
<p>To-morrow came, and with it two eager little figures rose and
gulped their porridge, and set off to see Thrums. They were dressed
in the black clothes Aaron Latta had bought for them in London, and
they had agreed just to walk, but when they reached the door and
saw the tree-tops of the Den they--they ran. Would you not like to
hold them back? It is a child's tragedy.</p>
<p>They went first into the Den, and the rocks were dripping wet,
all the trees save the firs were bare, and the mud round a tiny
spring pulled off one of Elspeth's boots.</p>
<p>"Tommy," she cried, quaking, "that narsty puddle can't not be
the Cuttle Well, can it?"</p>
<p>"No, it ain't," said Tommy, quickly, but he feared it was.</p>
<p>"It's c-c-colder here than London," Elspeth said, shivering, and
Tommy was shivering too, but he answered, "I'm--I'm--I'm warm."</p>
<p>The Den was strangely small, and soon they were on a shabby
brae, where women in short gowns came to their doors and men in
night-caps sat down on the shafts of their barrows to look at Jean
Myles's bairns.</p>
<p>"What does yer think?" Elspeth whispered, very doubtfully.</p>
<p>"They're beauties," Tommy answered, determinedly.</p>
<p>Presently Elspeth cried, "Oh, Tommy, what a ugly stair! Where is
the beauty stairs as it wore outside for show?"</p>
<p>This was one of them, and Tommy knew it. "Wait till you see the
west town end," he said, bravely: "it's grand." But when they were
in the west town end, and he had to admit it, "Wait till you see
the square," he said, and when they were in the square, "Wait," he
said, huskily, "till you see the town-house." Alas, this was the
town-house facing them, and when they knew it, he said, hurriedly,
"Wait till you see the Auld Licht kirk."</p>
<p>They stood long in front of the Auld Licht kirk, which he had
sworn was bigger and lovelier than St. Paul's, but--well, it is a
different style of architecture, and had Elspeth not been there
with tears in waiting, Tommy would have blubbered. "It's--it's
littler than I thought," he said, desperately, "but--the minister,
oh, what a wonderful big man he is!"</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" Elspeth squeaked.</p>
<p>"I swear he is."</p>
<p>The church door opened and a gentleman came out, a little man,
boyish in the back, with the eager face of those who live too
quickly. But it was not at him that Tommy pointed reassuringly; it
was at the monster church key, half of which protruded from his
tail pocket and waggled as he moved, like the hilt of a sword.</p>
<p>Speaking like an old residenter, Tommy explained that he had
brought his sister to see the church. "She's ta'en aback," he said,
picking out Scotch words carefully, "because it's littler than the
London kirks, but I telled her--I telled her that the preaching is
better."</p>
<p>This seemed to please the stranger, for he patted Tommy on the
head while inquiring, "How do you know that the preaching is
better?"</p>
<p>"Tell him, Elspeth," replied Tommy, modestly.</p>
<p>"There ain't nuthin' as Tommy don't know," Elspeth explained.
"He knows what the minister is like, too."</p>
<p>"He's a noble sight," said Tommy.</p>
<p>"He can get anything from God he likes," said Elspeth.</p>
<p>"He's a terrible big man," said Tommy.</p>
<p>This seemed to please the little gentleman less. "Big!" he
exclaimed, irritably; "why should he be big?"</p>
<p>"He is big," Elspeth almost screamed, for the minister was her
last hope.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said the little gentleman. "He is--well, I am the
minister."</p>
<p>"You!" roared Tommy, wrathfully.</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" sobbed Elspeth.</p>
<p>For a moment the Rev. Mr. Dishart looked as if he would like to
knock two little heads together, but he walked away without doing
it.</p>
<p>"Never mind," whispered Tommy hoarsely to Elspeth. "Never mind,
Elspeth, you have me yet."</p>
<p>This consolation seldom failed to gladden her, but her
disappointment was so sharp to-day that she would not even look
up.</p>
<p>"Come away to the cemetery, it's grand," he said; but still she
would not be comforted.</p>
<p>"And I'll let you hold my hand--as soon as we're past the
houses," he added.</p>
<p>"I'll let you hold it now," he said, eventually; but even then
Elspeth cried dismally, and her sobs were hurting him more than
her.</p>
<p>He knew all the ways of getting round Elspeth, and when next he
spoke it was with a sorrowful dignity. "I didna think," he said,
"as yer wanted me never to be able to speak again; no, I didna
think it, Elspeth."</p>
<p>She took her hands from her face and looked at him
inquiringly.</p>
<p>"One of the stories mamma telled me and Reddy," he said, "were a
man what saw such a beauty thing that he was struck dumb with
admiration. Struck dumb is never to be able to speak again, and I
wish I had been struck dumb when you wanted it."</p>
<p>"But I didn't want it!" Elspeth cried.</p>
<p>"If Thrums had been one little bit beautier than it is," he went
on, solemnly, "it would have struck me dumb. It would have hurt me
sore, but what about that, if it pleased you!"</p>
<p>Then did Elspeth see what a wicked girl she had been, and when
next the two were seen by the curious (it was on the cemetery
road), they were once more looking cheerful. At the smallest
provocation they exchanged notes of admiration, such as, "O Tommy,
what a bonny barrel!" or "O Elspeth, I tell yer that's a dike, and
there's just walls in London;" but sometimes Elspeth would stoop
hastily, pretending that she wanted to tie her boot-lace, but
really to brush away a tear, and there were moments when Tommy hung
very limp. Each was trying to deceive the other for the other's
sake, and one of them was never good at deception. They saw through
each other, yet kept up the chilly game, because they could think
of nothing better; and perhaps the game was worth playing, for love
invented it.</p>

<br>
<center>From 'Sentimental Tommy'</center>
<br>
<p>With the darkness, too, crept into the Muckley certain devils in
the color of the night who spoke thickly and rolled braw lads in
the mire, and egged on friends to fight, and cast lewd thoughts
into the minds of the women. At first the men had been bashful
swains. To the women's "Gie me my faring, Jock," they had replied,
"Wait, Jean, till I'm fee'd," but by night most had got their
arles, with a dram above it, and he who could only guffaw at Jean a
few hours ago had her round the waist now, and still an arm free
for rough play with other kimmers. The Jeans were as boisterous as
the Jocks, giving them leer for leer, running from them with a
giggle, waiting to be caught and rudely kissed. Grand, patient,
long-suffering fellows these men were, up at five, summer and
winter, foddering their horses, maybe, hours before there would be
food for themselves, miserably paid, housed like cattle, and when
the rheumatism seized them, liable to be flung aside like a broken
graip. As hard was the life of the women: coarse food, chaff beds,
damp clothes their portion; their sweethearts in the service of
masters who were loth to fee a married man. Is it to be wondered
that these lads who could be faithful unto death drank soddenly on
their one free day; that these girls, starved of opportunities for
womanliness, of which they could make as much as the finest lady,
sometimes woke after a Muckley to wish that they might wake no
more?</p>

<h2>FR&Eacute;D&Eacute;RIC BASTIAT</h2>
<h3>(1801-1850)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-p.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>olitical economy has been called the "dismal science"; and
probably the majority think of it as either merely a matter of
words and phrases, or as something too abstruse for the common mind
to comprehend. It was the distinction of Bastiat that he was able
to write economic tracts in such a language that he that ran might
read, and to clothe the apparently dry bones with such integuments
as manifested vitality. Under his pen, questions of finance, of
tax, of exchange, became questions which concern the lives of
individual men and women, with sentiments, hopes, and
aspirations.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-175.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bastiat.</b></p>
<p>He was born at Bayonne in France, June 19th, 1801. At nine years
of age he was left an orphan, but he was cared for by his
grandfather and aunt. He received his schooling at the college of
St. Sever and at Sor&egrave;ze, where he was noted as a diligent
student. When about twenty years of age he was taken into the
commercial house of his uncle at Bayonne. His leisure was employed
in cultivating art and literature, and he became accomplished in
languages and in instrumental and vocal music. He was early
interested in political and social economy through the writings of
Adam Smith, J.B. Say, Comte, and others; and having inherited
considerable landed property at Mugron on the death of his
grandfather in 1827, he undertook the personal charge of it, at the
same time continuing his economic studies. His experiment in
farming did not prove successful; but he rapidly developed clear
ideas upon economical problems, being much assisted in their
consideration by frequent conferences with his neighbor, M. Felix
Coudroy. These two worked much together, and cherished a close
sympathy in thought and heart.</p>
<p>The bourgeois revolution of 1830 was welcomed enthusiastically
by Bastiat. It was a revolution of prosperous and well-instructed
men, willing to make sacrifices to attain an orderly and systematic
method of government. To him the form of the administration did not
greatly matter: the right to vote taxes was the right which
governed the governors. "There is always a tendency on the part of
governments to extend their powers," he said; "the administration
therefore must be under constant surveillance." His motto was "Foi
systematiqtie &agrave; la libre activit&eacute; de I'individu;
defiance systematique vis-&agrave;-vis de l'&Eacute;tat
con&ccedil;u abstraitement,--c'est-&agrave;-dire, defiance
parfaitement pure de toute hostilit&eacute; de parti." [Systematic
faith in the free activity of the individual; systematic distrust
of the State conceived abstractly,--that is, a distrust entirely
free from prejudice.]</p>
<p>His work with his pen seems to have been begun about 1830, and
from the first was concerned with matters of economy and
government. A year later he was chosen to local office, and every
opportunity which offered was seized upon to bring before the
common people the true milk of the economic word, as he conceived
it. The germ of his theory of values appeared in a pamphlet of
1834, and the line of his development was a steady one; his leading
principles being the importance of restricting the functions of
government to the maintenance of order, and of removing all
shackles from the freedom of production and exchange. Through
subscription to an English periodical he became familiar with
Cobden and the Anti-Corn-Law League, and his subsequent intimacy
with Cobden contributed much to broaden his horizon. In 1844-5
appeared his brilliant 'Sophismes &eacute;conomiques', which in
their kind have never been equaled; and his reputation rapidly
expanded. He enthusiastically espoused the cause of Free Trade, and
issued a work entitled 'Cobden et la Ligue, ou l'Agitation anglaise
pour la libert&eacute; des &eacute;changes' (Cobden and the League,
or the English Agitation for Liberty of Exchange), which attracted
great attention, and won for its author the title of corresponding
member of the Institute. A movement for organization in favor of
tariff reform was begun, of which he naturally became a leader; and
feeling that Paris was the centre from which influence should flow,
to Paris he removed. M. de Molinari gives an account of his
debut:--"We still seem to see him making his first round among the
journals which had shown themselves favorable to cause of the
freedom of commerce. He had not yet had time to call upon a
Parisian tailor or hatter, and in truth it had not occurred to him
to do so. With his long hair and his small hat, his large surtout
and his family umbrella, he would naturally be taken for a
reputable countryman looking at the sights of the metropolis. But
his countryman's-face was at the same time roguish and spirituelle,
his large black eyes were bright and luminous, and his forehead, of
medium breadth but squarely formed, bore the imprint of thought. At
a glance one could see that he was a peasant of the country of
Montaigne, and in listening to him one realized that here was a
disciple of Franklin."</p>
<p>He plunged at once into work, and his activity was prodigious.
He contributed to numerous journals, maintained an active
correspondence with Cobden, kept up communications with
organizations throughout the country, and was always ready to meet
his opponents in debate.</p>
<p>The Republic of 1848 was accepted in good faith; but he was
strongly impressed by the extravagant schemes which accompanied the
Republican movement, as well as by the thirst for peace which
animated multitudes. The Provisional government had made solemn
promises: it must pile on taxes to enable it to keep its promises.
"Poor people! How they have deceived themselves! It would have been
so easy and so just to have eased matters by reducing the taxes;
instead, this is to be done by profusion of expenditure, and people
do not see that all this machinery amounts to taking away ten in
order to return eight, <i>without counting the fact that liberty
will succumb under the operation</i>." He tried to stem the tide of
extravagance; he published a journal, the R&eacute;publique
Fran&ccedil;aise, for the express purpose of promulgating his
views; he entered the Constituent and then the Legislative
Assembly, as a member for the department of Landes, and spoke
eloquently from the tribune. He was a constitutional "Mugwump": he
cared for neither parties nor men, but for ideas. He was equally
opposed to the domination of arbitrary power and to the tyranny of
Socialism. He voted with the right against the left on extravagant
Utopian schemes, and with the left against the right when he felt
that the legitimate complaints of the poor and suffering were
unheeded.</p>
<p>In the midst of his activity he was overcome by a trouble in the
throat, which induced his physicians to send him to Italy. The
effort for relief was a vain one, however, and he died in Rome
December 24th, 1850. His complete works, mostly composed of
occasional essays, were printed in 1855. Besides those mentioned,
the most important are 'Propri&eacute;t&eacute; et Loi' (Property
and Law), 'Justice et Fraternit&eacute;,' 'Protectionisme et
Communisme,' and 'Harmonies &eacute;conomiques.' The 'Harmonies
&eacute;conomiques' and 'Sophismes &eacute;conomiques' have been
translated and published in English.</p>

<p>We are suffering from the intolerable competition of a foreign
rival, placed, it would seem, in a condition so far superior to
ours for the production of light, that he absolutely
<i>inundates</i> our <i>national market</i> with it at a price
fabulously reduced. The moment he shows himself, our trade leaves
us--all consumers apply to him; and a branch of native industry,
having countless ramifications, is all at once rendered completely
stagnant. This rival, who is no other than the Sun, wages war to
the knife against us, and we suspect that he has been raised up by
<i>perfidious Albion</i> (good policy as times go); inasmuch as he
displays towards that haughty island a circumspection with which he
dispenses in our case.</p>
<p>What we pray for is, that it may please you to pass a law
ordering the shutting up of all windows, skylights, dormer windows,
outside and inside shutters, curtains, blinds, bull's-eyes; in a
word, of all openings, holes, chinks, clefts, and fissures, by or
through which the light of the sun has been in use to enter houses,
to the prejudice of the meritorious manufactures with which we
flatter ourselves we have accommodated our country,--a country
which, in gratitude, ought not to abandon us now to a strife so
unequal.</p>
<p>We trust, gentlemen, that you will not regard this our request
as a satire, or refuse it without at least previously hearing the
reasons which we have to urge in its support.</p>
<p>And first, if you shut up as much as possible all access to
natural light, and create a demand for artificial light, which of
our French manufactures will not be encouraged by it?</p>
<p>If more tallow is consumed, then there must be more oxen and
sheep; and consequently, we shall behold the multiplication of
artificial meadows, meat, wool, hides, and above all manure, which
is the basis and foundation of all agricultural wealth.</p>
<p>If more oil is consumed, then we shall have an extended
cultivation of the poppy, of the olive, and of rape. These rich and
exhausting plants will come at the right time to enable us to avail
ourselves of the increased fertility which the rearing of
additional cattle will impart to our lands.</p>
<p>Our heaths will be covered with resinous trees. Numerous swarms
of bees will, on the mountains, gather perfumed treasures, now
wasting their fragrance on the desert air, like the flowers from
which they emanate. No branch of agriculture but will then exhibit
a cheering development.</p>
<p>The same remark applies to navigation. Thousands of vessels will
proceed to the whale fishery; and in a short time we shall possess
a navy capable of maintaining the honor of France, and gratifying
the patriotic aspirations of your petitioners, the under-signed
candle-makers and others.</p>
<p>But what shall we say of the manufacture of <i>articles de
Paris?</i> Henceforth you will behold gildings, bronzes, crystals,
in candlesticks, in lamps, in lustres, in candelabra, shining forth
in spacious warerooms, compared with which those of the present day
can be regarded but as mere shops.</p>
<p>No poor <i>r&eacute;sinier</i> from his heights on the
sea-coast, no coal-miner from the depth of his sable gallery, but
will rejoice in higher wages and increased prosperity.</p>
<p>Only have the goodness to reflect, gentlemen, and you will be
convinced that there is perhaps no Frenchman, from the wealthy
coal-master to the humblest vender of lucifer matches, whose lot
will not be ameliorated by the success of this our petition.</p>
<p>We foresee your objections, gentlemen, but we know that you can
oppose to us none but such as you have picked up from the effete
works of the partisans of Free Trade. We defy you to utter a single
word against us which will not instantly rebound against yourselves
and your entire policy.</p>
<p>You will tell us that if we gain by the protection which we
seek, the country will lose by it, because the consumer must bear
the loss.</p>
<p>We answer:--</p>
<p>You have ceased to have any right to invoke the interest of the
consumer; for whenever his interest is found opposed to that of the
producer, you sacrifice the former. You have done so for the
purpose of <i>encouraging labor and increasing employment</i>. For
the same reason you should do so again.</p>
<p>You have yourself refuted this objection. When you are told that
the consumer is interested in the free importation of iron, coal,
corn, textile fabrics--yes, you reply, but the producer is
interested in their exclusion. Well, be it so;--if consumers are
interested in the free admission of natural light, the producers of
artificial light are equally interested in its prohibition.</p>
<p>But again, you may say that the producer and consumer are
identical. If the manufacturer gain by protection, he will make the
agriculturist also a gainer; and if agriculture prosper, it will
open a vent to manufactures. Very well: if you confer upon us the
monopoly of furnishing light during the day,--first of all, we
shall purchase quantities of tallow, coals, oils, resinous
substances, wax, alcohol--besides silver, iron, bronze, crystal--to
carry on our manufactures; and then we, and those who furnish us
with such commodities, having become rich, will consume a great
deal, and impart prosperity to all the other branches of our
national industry.</p>
<p>If you urge that the light of the sun is a gratuitous gift of
nature, and that to reject such gifts is to reject wealth itself
under pretense of encouraging the means of acquiring it, we would
caution you against giving a death-blow to your own policy.
Remember that hitherto you have always repelled foreign products,
<i>because</i> they approximate more nearly than home products to
the character of gratuitous gifts. To comply with the exactions of
other monopolists, you have only <i>half a motive</i>; and to
repulse us simply because we stand on a stronger vantage-ground
than others would be to adopt the equation, +X+=--; in other words,
it would be to heap <i>absurdity</i> upon <i>absurdity</i>.</p>
<p>Nature and human labor co-operate in various proportions
(depending on countries and climates) in the production of
commodities. The part which nature executes is always gratuitous;
it is the part executed by human labor which constitutes value, and
is paid for.</p>
<p>If a Lisbon orange sells for half the price of a Paris orange,
it is because natural and consequently gratuitous heat does for the
one what artificial and therefore expensive heat must do for the
other.</p>
<p>When an orange comes to us from Portugal, we may conclude that
it is furnished in part gratuitously, in part for an onerous
consideration; in other words, it comes to us at <i>half-price</i>
as compared with those of Paris.</p>
<p>Now, it is precisely the <i>gratuitous half</i> (pardon the
word) which we contend should be excluded. You say, How can natural
labor sustain competition with foreign labor, when the former has
all the work to do, and the latter only does one-half, the sun
supplying the remainder? But if this <i>half</i>, being
<i>gratuitous</i>, determines you to exclude competition, how
should the <i>whole</i>, being <i>gratuitous</i>, induce you to
admit competition? If you were consistent, you would, while
excluding as hurtful to native industry what is half gratuitous,
exclude <i>a fortiori</i> and with double zeal that which is
altogether gratuitous.</p>
<p>Once more, when products such as coal, iron, corn, or textile
fabrics are sent us from abroad, and we can acquire them with less
labor than if we made them ourselves, the difference is a free gift
conferred upon us. The gift is more or less considerable in
proportion as the difference is more or less great. It amounts to a
quarter, a half, or three-quarters of the value of the product,
when the foreigner only asks us for three-fourths, a half, or a
quarter of the price we should otherwise pay. It is as perfect and
complete as it can be, when the donor (like the sun in furnishing
us with light) asks us for nothing. The question, and we ask it
formally, is this, Do you desire for our country the benefit of
gratuitous consumption, or the pretended advantages of onerous
production? Make your choice, but be logical; for as long as you
exclude, as you do, coal, iron, corn, foreign fabrics, <i>in
proportion</i> as their price approximates to <i>zero</i>, what
inconsistency would it be to admit the light of the sun, the price
of which is already at <i>zero</i> during the entire day!</p>

<center><b>STULTA AND PUERA</b></center>
<br>
<p>There were, no matter where, two towns called Fooltown and
Babytown. They completed at great cost a highway from the one town
to the other. When this was done, Fooltown said to herself, "See
how Babytown inundates us with her products; we must see to it." In
consequence, they created and paid a body of <i>obstructives</i>,
so called because their business was to place <i>obstacles</i> in
the way of traffic coming from Babytown. Soon afterwards Babytown
did the same.</p>
<p>At the end of some centuries, knowledge having in the interim
made great progress, the common sense of Babytown enabled her to
see that such reciprocal obstacles could only be reciprocally
hurtful. She therefore sent a diplomatist to Fooltown, who, laying
aside official phraseology, spoke to this effect:</p>
<p>"We have made a highway, and now we throw obstacles in the way
of using it. This is absurd. It would have been better to have left
things as they were. We should not, in that case, have had to pay
for making the road in the first place, nor afterwards have
incurred the expense of maintaining <i>obstructives</i>. In the
name of Babytown, I come to propose to you, not to give up opposing
each other all at once,--that would be to act upon a principle, and
we despise principles as much as you do,--but to lessen somewhat
the present obstacles, taking care to estimate equitably the
respective <i>sacrifices</i> we make for this purpose."</p>
<p>So spoke the diplomatist. Fooltown asked for time to consider
the proposal, and proceeded to consult in succession her
manufacturers and agriculturists. At length, after the lapse of
some years, she declared that the negotiations were broken off. On
receiving this intimation, the inhabitants of Babytown held a
meeting. An old gentleman (they always suspected he had been
secretly bought by Fooltown) rose and said:--"The obstacles created
by Fooltown injure our sales, which is a misfortune. Those which we
have ourselves created injure our purchases, which is another
misfortune. With reference to the first, we are powerless; but the
second rests with ourselves. Let us at least get quit of one, since
we cannot rid ourselves of both evils. Let us suppress our
<i>obstructives</i> without requiring Fooltown to do the same. Some
day, no doubt, she will come to know her own interests better."</p>
<p>A second counselor, a practical, matter-of-fact man, guiltless
of any acquaintance with principles, and brought up in the ways of
his forefathers, replied--</p>
<p>"Don't listen to that Utopian dreamer, that theorist, that
innovator, that economist; that <i>Stultomaniac</i>. We shall all
be undone if the stoppages of the road are not equalized, weighed,
and balanced between Fooltown and Babytown. There would be greater
difficulty in <i>going</i> than in <i>coming</i>, in
<i>exporting</i> than in <i>importing</i>. We should find ourselves
in the same condition of inferiority relatively to Fooltown, as
Havre, Nantes, Bordeaux, Lisbon, London, Hamburg, and New Orleans,
are with relation to the towns situated at the sources of the
Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Tagus, the Thames, the Elbe, and
the Mississippi; for it is more difficult for a ship to ascend than
to descend a river. [<i>A Voice</i>--'Towns at the
<i>embouchures</i> of rivers prosper more than towns at their
source.'] This is impossible. [<i>Same Voice</i>--'But it is so.']
Well, if it be so, they have prospered <i>contrary to
rules</i>."</p>
<p>Reasoning so conclusive convinced the assembly, and the orator
followed up his victory by talking largely of national
independence, national honor, national dignity, national labor,
inundation of products, tributes, murderous competition. In short,
he carried the vote in favor of the maintenance of obstacles; and
if you are at all curious on the subject, I can point out to you
countries, where you will see with your own eyes Roadmakers and
Obstructives working together on the most friendly terms possible,
under the orders of the same legislative assembly, and at the
expense of the same taxpayers, the one set endeavoring to clear the
road, and the other set doing their utmost to render it
impassable.</p>

<center><b>INAPPLICABLE TERMS</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Economic Sophisms'</center>
<br>
<p>Let us give up ... the puerility of applying to industrial
competition phrases applicable to war,--a way of speaking which is
only specious when applied to competition between two rival trades.
The moment we come to take into account the effect produced on the
general prosperity, the analogy disappears.</p>
<p>In a battle, every one who is killed diminishes by so much the
strength of the army. In industry, a workshop is shut up only when
what it produced is obtained by the public from another source and
in <i>greater abundance</i>. Figure a state of things where for one
man killed on the spot two should rise up full of life and vigor.
Were such a state of things possible, war would no longer merit its
name.</p>
<p>This, however, is the distinctive character of what is so
absurdly called <i>industrial war</i>.</p>
<p>Let the Belgians and the English lower the price of their iron
ever so much; let them, if they will, send it to us for nothing:
this might extinguish some of our blast-furnaces; but immediately,
and as a <i>necessary</i> consequence of this very cheapness, there
would rise up a thousand other branches of industry more profitable
than the one which had been superseded.</p>
<p>We arrive, then, at the conclusion that domination by labor is
impossible, and a contradiction in terms, seeing that all
superiority which manifests itself among a people means cheapness,
and tends only to impart force to all other nations. Let us banish,
then, from political economy all terms borrowed from the military
vocabulary: <i>to fight with equal weapons, to conquer, to crush,
to stifle, to be beaten, invasion, tribute</i>, etc. What do such
phrases mean? Squeeze them, and you obtain nothing. Yes, you do
obtain something; for from such words proceed absurd errors, and
fatal and pestilent prejudices. Such phrases tend to arrest the
fusion of nations, are inimical to their peaceful, universal, and
indissoluble alliance, and retard the progress of the human
race.</p>

<h2>CHARLES BAUDELAIRE</h2>
<h3>(1821-1867)</h3>
<center>BY GRACE KING</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-c.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>harles Baudelaire was born in Paris in 1821; he died there in
1867. Between these dates lies the evolution of one of the most
striking personalities in French literature, and the development of
an influence which affected not only the literature of the poet's
own country, but that of all Europe and America. The genuineness of
both personality and influence was one of the first critical issues
raised after Baudelaire's advent into literature; it is still one
of the main issues in all critical consideration of him. A question
which involves by implication the whole relation of poetry, and of
art as such, to life, is obviously one that furnishes more than
literary issues, and engages other than literary interests. And
thus, by easy and natural corollaries, Baudelaire has been made a
subject of appeal not only to judgment, but even to conscience. At
first sight, therefore, he appears surrounded either by an
intricate moral maze, or by a no less troublesome confusion of
contradictory theories from opposing camps rather than schools of
criticism. But no author--no dead author--is more accessible, or
more communicable in his way; his poems, his theories, and a goodly
portion of his life, lie at the disposition of any reader who cares
to know him.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-185.png" width="45%" alt=

<b>Charles Baudelaire.</b></p>
<p>The Baudelaire legend, as it is called by French critics, is one
of the blooms of that romantic period of French literature which is
presided over by the genius of Th&eacute;ophile Gautier. Indeed; it
is against the golden background of Gautier's imagination that the
picture of the youthful poet is best preserved for us, appearing in
all the delicate and illusive radiance of the youth and beauty of
legendary saints on the gilded canvases of mediaeval art. The
radiant youth and beauty may be no more truthful to nature than the
gilded background, but the fact of the impression sought to be
conveyed is not on that account to be disbelieved.</p>
<p>Baudelaire, Gautier writes, was born in the Rue Hautefeuille, in
one of those old houses with a pepper-pot turret at the corner
which have disappeared from the city under the advancing
improvement of straight lines and clear openings. His father, a
gentleman of learning, retained all the eighteenth-century courtesy
and distinction of manner, which, like the pepper-pot turret, has
also disappeared under the advance of Republican enlightenment. An
absent-minded, reserved child, Baudelaire attracted no especial
attention during his school days. When they were over, his
predilection for a literary vocation became known. From this his
parents sought to divert him by sending him to travel. He voyaged
through the Indian Ocean, visiting the great islands: Madagascar,
Ceylon, Mauritius, Bourbon. Had there been a chance for
irresolution in the mind of the youth, this voyage destroyed it
forever. His imagination, essentially exotic, succumbed to the
passionate charm of a new, strange, and splendidly glowing form of
nature; the stars, the skies, the gigantic vegetation, the color,
the perfumes, the dark-skinned figures in white draperies, formed
for him at that time a heaven, for which his senses unceasingly
yearned afterwards amid the charms and enchantments of
civilization, in the world's capital of pleasure and luxury.
Returning to Paris, of age and master of his fortune, he
established himself in his independence, openly adopting his chosen
career.</p>
<p>He and Th&eacute;ophile Gautier met for the first time in 1849,
in the Hotel Pimodau, where were held the meetings of the Hashish
Club. Here in the great Louis XIV. saloon, with its wood-work
relieved with dull gold; its corbeled ceiling, painted after the
manner of Lesueur and Poussin, with satyrs pursuing nymphs through
reeds and foliage; its great red and white spotted marble mantel,
with gilded elephant harnessed like the elephant of Porus in
Lebrun's picture, bearing an enameled clock with blue ciphers; its
antique chairs and sofas, covered with faded tapestry representing
hunting scenes, holding the reclining figures of the members of the
club; women celebrated in the world of beauty, men in the world of
letters, meeting not only for the enjoyment of the artificial
ecstasies of the drug, but to talk of art, literature, and love, as
in the days of the Decameron--here Baudelaire made what might be
called his historic impression upon literature. He was at that time
twenty-eight years of age; and even in that assemblage, in those
surroundings, his personality was striking. His black hair, worn
close to the head, grew in regular scallops over a forehead of
dazzling whiteness; his eyes, the color of Spanish tobacco, were
spiritual, deep, penetrating, perhaps too insistently so, in
expression; the mobile sinuous mouth had the ironical voluptuous
lips that Leonardo da Vinci loved to paint; the nose was delicate
and sensitive, with quivering nostrils; a deep dimple accentuated
the chin; the bluish-black tint of the shaven skin, softened with
rice-powder, contrasted with the clear rose and white of the upper
part of his cheeks. Always dressed with meticulous neatness and
simplicity, following English rather than French taste; in manner
punctiliously observant of the strictest conventionality,
scrupulously, even excessively polite; in talk measuring his
phrases, using only the most select terms, and pronouncing certain
words as if the sound itself possessed a certain subtle, mystical
value,--throwing his voice into capitals and italics;--in contrast
with the dress and manners about him, he, according to Gautier,
looked like a dandy who had strayed into Bohemia.</p>
<p>The contrast was no less violent between Baudelaire's form and
the substance of his conversation. With a simple, natural, and
perfectly impartial manner, as if he were conveying commonplace
information about every-day life, he would advance some axiom
monstrously Satanic, or sustain, with the utmost grace and
coolness, some mathematical extravagance in the way of a theory.
And no one could so inflexibly push a paradox to the uttermost
limits, regardless of consequences to received notions of morality
or religion; always employing the most rigorous methods of logic
and reason. His wit was found to lie neither in words nor thoughts,
but in the peculiar standpoint from which he regarded things, a
standpoint which altered their outlines,--like those of objects
looked down upon from a bird's flight, or looked up to on a
ceiling. In this way, to continue the exposition of Gautier,
Baudelaire saw relations inappreciable to others, whose logical
bizarrerie was startling.</p>
<p>His first productions were critical articles for the Parisian
journals; articles that at the time passed unperceived, but which
to-day furnish perhaps the best evidences of that keen artistic
insight and foresight of the poet, which was at once his greatest
good and evil genius. In 1856 appeared his translation of the works
of Edgar Allan Poe; a translation which may be said to have
naturalized Poe in French literature, where he has played a role
curiously like that of Baudelaire in Poe's native literature. The
natural predisposition of Baudelaire, which fitted him to be the
French interpreter of Poe, rendered him also peculiarly sensitive
to Poe's mysteriously subtle yet rankly vigorous charms; and he
showed himself as sensitively responsive to these as he had been to
the exotic charms of the East. The influence upon his intellectual
development was decisive and final. His indebtedness to Poe, or it
might better be said, his identification with Poe, is visible not
only in his paradoxical manias, but in his poetry, and in his
theories of art and poetry set forth in his various essays and
fugitive prose expressions, and notably in his introduction to his
translations of the American author's works.</p>
<p>In 1857 appeared the "Fleurs du Mal" (Flowers of Evil), the
volume of poems upon which Baudelaire's fame as a poet is founded.
It was the result of his thirty years' devotion to the study of his
art and meditation upon it. Six of the poems were suppressed by the
censor of the Second Empire. This action called out, in form of
protest, that fine appreciation and defense of Baudelaire's genius
and best defense of his methods, by four of the foremost critics
and keenest artists in poetry of Paris, which form, with the
letters from Sainte-Beuve, de Custine, and Deschamps, a precious
appendix to the third edition of the poems.</p>
<p>The name 'Flowers of Evil' is a sufficient indication of the
intentions and aim of the author. Their companions in the volume
are: 'Spleen and Ideal,' 'Parisian Pictures,' 'Wine,' 'Revolt,'
'Death.' The simplest description of them is that they are
indescribable. They must not only be read, they must be studied
repeatedly to be understood as they deserve. The paradox of their
most exquisite art, and their at times most revolting revelations
of the degradations and perversities of humanity, can be accepted
with full appreciation of the author's meaning only by granting the
same paradox to his genuine nature; by crediting him with being not
only an ardent idealist of art for art's sake, but an idealist of
humanity for humanity's sake; one to whom humanity, even in its
lowest degradations and vilest perversions, is sublimely
sacred;--one to whom life offered but one tragedy, that of human
souls flying like Cain from a guilt-stricken paradise, but pursued
by the remorse of innocence, and scourged by the consciousness of
their own infinitude.</p>
<p>But the poet's own words are the best explanation of his aim and
intention:--</p>
<blockquote>"Poetry, though one delve ever so little into his own
self, interrogate his own soul, recall his memories of enthusiasms,
has no other end than itself; it cannot have any other aim, and no
poem will be so great, so noble, so truly worthy of the name of
poem, as that which shall have been written solely for the pleasure
of writing a poem. I do not wish to say that poetry should not
ennoble manners--that its final result should not be to raise man
above vulgar interests. That would be an evident absurdity. I say
that if the poet has pursued a moral end, he has diminished his
poetic force, and it would not be imprudent to wager that his work
would be bad. Poetry cannot, under penalty of death or forfeiture,
assimilate itself to science or morality. It has not Truth for
object, it has only itself. Truth's modes of demonstration are
different and elsewhere. Truth has nothing to do with ballads; all
that constitutes the charm, the irresistible grace of a ballad,
would strip Truth of its authority and power. Cold, calm,
impassive, the demonstrative temperament rejects the diamonds and
flowers of the muse; it is, therefore, the absolute inverse of the
poetic temperament. Pure Intellect aims at Truth, Taste shows us
Beauty, and the Moral Sense teaches us Duty. It is true that the
middle term has intimate connection with the two extremes, and only
separates itself from Moral Sense by a difference so slight that
Aristotle did not hesitate to class some of its delicate operations
amongst the virtues. And accordingly what, above all, exasperates
the man of taste is the spectacle of vice, is its deformity, its
disproportions. Vice threatens the just and true, and revolts
intellect and conscience; but as an outrage upon harmony, as
dissonance, it would particularly wound certain poetic minds, and I
do not think it would be scandal to consider all infractions of
moral beauty as a species of sin against rhythm and universal
prosody.<br>
<br>
"It is this admirable, this immortal instinct of the Beautiful
which makes us consider the earth and its spectacle as a sketch, as
a correspondent of Heaven. The insatiable thirst for all that is
beyond that which life veils is the most living proof of our
immortality. It is at once by poetry and across it, across and
through music, that the soul gets a glimpse of the splendors that
lie beyond the tomb. And when an exquisite poem causes tears to
rise in the eye, these tears are not the proof of excessive
enjoyment, but rather the testimony of a moved melancholy, of a
postulation of the nerves, of a nature exiled in the imperfect,
which wishes to take immediate possession, even on earth, of a
revealed paradise.<br>
<br>
"Thus the principle of poetry is strictly and simply human
aspiration toward superior beauty; and the manifestation of this
principle is enthusiasm and uplifting of the soul,--enthusiasm
entirely independent of passion,--which is the intoxication of
heart, and of truth which is the food of reason. For passion is a
natural thing, even too natural not to introduce a wounding,
discordant tone into the domain of pure beauty; too familiar, too
violent, not to shock the pure Desires, the gracious Melancholies,
and the noble Despairs which inhabit the supernatural regions of
poetry."</blockquote>
<p>Baudelaire saw himself as the poet of a decadent epoch, an epoch
in which art had arrived at the over-ripened maturity of an aging
civilization; a glowing, savorous, fragrant over-ripeness, that is
already softening into decomposition. And to be the fitting poet of
such an epoch, he modeled his style on that of the poets of the
Latin decadence; for, as he expressed it for himself and for the
modern school of "decadents" in French poetry founded upon his
name:--</p>
<blockquote>"Does it not seem to the reader, as to me, that the
language of the last Latin decadence--that supreme sigh of a robust
person already transformed and prepared for spiritual life--is
singularly fitted to express passion as it is understood and felt
by the modern world? Mysticism is the other end of the magnet of
which Catullus and his band, brutal and purely epidermic poets,
knew only the sensual pole. In this wonderful language, solecisms
and barbarisms seem to express the forced carelessness of a passion
which forgets itself, and mocks at rules. The words, used in a
novel sense, reveal the charming awkwardness of a barbarian from
the North, kneeling before Roman Beauty."</blockquote>
<p>Nature, the nature of Wordsworth and Tennyson, did not exist for
Baudelaire; inspiration he denied; simplicity he scouted as an
anachronism in a decadent period of perfected art, whose last word
in poetry should be the apotheosis of the Artificial. "A little
charlatanism is permitted even to genius," he wrote: "it is like
fard on the cheeks of a naturally beautiful woman; an appetizer for
the mind." Again he expresses himself:</p>
<blockquote>"It seems to me, two women are presented to me, one a
rustic matron, repulsive in health and virtue, without manners,
without expression; in short, owing nothing except to simple
nature;--the other, one of those beauties that dominate and oppress
memory, uniting to her original and unfathomable charms all the
eloquence of dress; who is mistress of her part, conscious of and
queen of herself, speaking like an instrument well tuned; with
looks freighted with thought, yet letting flow only what she would.
My choice would not be doubtful; and yet there are pedagogic
sphinxes who would reproach me as recreant to classical
honor."</blockquote>
<p>In music it was the same choice. He saw the consummate art and
artificiality of Wagner, and preferred it to all other music, at a
time when the German master was ignored and despised by a
classicized musical world. In perfumes it was not the simple
fragrance of the rose or violet that he loved, but musk and amber;
and he said, "my soul hovers over perfumes as the souls of other
men hover over music."</p>
<p>Besides his essays and sketches, Baudelaire published in prose a
novelette; 'Fanfarlo,' 'Artificial Paradises,' opium and hashish,
imitations of De Quincey's 'Confessions of an Opium Eater'; and
'Little Prose Poems,' also inspired by a book, the 'Gaspard de la
Nuit' of Aloysius Bertrand, and which Baudelaire thus
describes:--</p>
<blockquote>"The idea came to me to attempt something analogous,
and to apply to the description of modern life, or rather a modern
and more abstract life, the methods he had applied to the painting
of ancient life, so strangely picturesque. Which one of us in his
ambitious days has not dreamed of a miracle of poetic prose,
musical, without rhythm and without rhyme, supple enough and rugged
enough to adapt itself to the lyrical movements of the soul, to the
undulations of reverie, and to the assaults of
conscience?"</blockquote>
<p>Failing health induced Baudelaire to quit Paris and establish
himself in Brussels; but he received no benefit from the change of
climate, and the first symptoms of his terrible malady manifested
themselves--a slowness of speech, and hesitation over words. As a
slow and sententious enunciation was characteristic of him, the
symptoms attracted no attention, until he fell under a sudden and
violent attack. He was brought back to Paris and conveyed to a
"maison de sant&eacute;," where he died, after lingering several
months in a paralyzed condition, motionless, speechless; nothing
alive in him but thought, seeking to express itself through his
eyes.</p>
<p>The nature of Baudelaire's malady and death was, by the public
at large, accepted as confirmation of the suspicion that he was in
the habit of seeking his inspiration in the excitation of hashish
and opium. His friends, however, recall the fact of his incessant
work, and intense striving after his ideal in art; his fatigue of
body and mind, and his increasing weariness of spirit under the
accumulating worries and griefs of a life for which his very genius
unfitted him. He was also known to be sober in his tastes, as all
great workers are. That he had lent himself more than once to the
physiological and psychological experiment of hashish was admitted;
but he was a rare visitor at the s&eacute;ances in the saloon of
the Hotel Pimodau, and came as a simple observer of others. His
masterly description of the hallucinations produced by hashish is
accompanied by analytical and moral commentaries which unmistakably
express repugnance to and condemnation of the drug:--</p>
<blockquote>"Admitting for the moment," he writes, "the hypothesis
of a constitution tempered enough and strong enough to resist the
evil effects of the perfidious drug, another, a fatal and terrible
danger, must be thought of,--that of habit. He who has recourse to
a poison to enable him to think, will soon not be able to think
without the poison. Imagine the horrible fate of a man whose
paralyzed imagination is unable to work without the aid of hashish
or opium.... But man is not so deprived of honest means of gaining
heaven, that he is obliged to invoke the aid of pharmacy or
witchcraft; he need not sell his soul in order to pay for the
intoxicating caresses and the love of houris. What is a paradise
that one purchases at the expense of one's own soul?... Unfortunate
wretches who have neither fasted nor prayed, and who have refused
the redemption of labor, ask from black magic the means to elevate
themselves at a single stroke to a supernatural existence. Magic
dupes them, and lights for them a false happiness and a false
light; while we, poets and philosophers, who have regenerated our
souls by incessant work and contemplation, by the assiduous
exercise of the will and permanent nobility of intention, we have
created for our use a garden of true beauty. Confiding in the words
that 'faith will remove mountains,' we have accomplished the one
miracle for which God has given us license."</blockquote>
<p>The perfect art-form of Baudelaire's poems makes translation of
them indeed a literal impossibility. The 'Little Old Women,' 'The
Voyage,' 'The Voyage to Cytherea,' 'A Red-haired Beggar-girl,' 'The
Seven Old Men,' and sonnet after sonnet in 'Spleen and Ideal,' seem
to rise only more and more ineffable from every attempt to filter
them through another language, or through another mind than that of
their original, and, it would seem, one possible creator.</p>

<center><b>THE PAINTER OF MODERN LIFE</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'L'Art Romantique'</center>
<br>
<p>The crowd is his domain, as the air is that of the bird and the
water that of the fish. His passion and his profession is "to wed
the crowd." For the perfect <i>fl&acirc;neur</i>, for the
passionate observer, it is an immense pleasure to choose his home
in number, change, motion, in the fleeting and the infinite. To be
away from one's home and yet to be always at home; to be in the
midst of the world, to see it, and yet to be hidden from it; such
are some of the least pleasures of these independent, passionate,
impartial minds which language can but awkwardly define. The
observer is a prince who everywhere enjoys his incognito. The
amateur of life makes the world his family, as the lover of the
fair sex makes his family of all beauties, discovered,
discoverable, and indiscoverable, as the lover of painting lives in
an enchanted dreamland painted on canvas. Thus the man who is in
love with all life goes into a crowd as into an immense electric
battery. One might also compare him to a mirror as immense as the
crowd; to a conscious kaleidoscope which in each movement
represents the multiform life and the moving grace of all life's
elements. He is an ego insatiably hungry for the non-ego, every
moment rendering it and expressing it in images more vital than
life itself, which is always unstable and fugitive. "Any man," said
Mr. G---- one day, in one of those conversations which he lights up
with intense look and vivid gesture, "any man, not overcome by a
sorrow so heavy that it absorbs all the faculties, who is bored in
the midst of a crowd is a fool, a fool, and I despise him."</p>
<p>When Mr. G---- awakens and sees the blustering sun attacking the
window-panes, he says with remorse, with regret:--"What imperial
order! What a trumpet flourish of light! For hours already there
has been light everywhere, light lost by my sleep! How many lighted
objects I might have seen and have not seen!" And then he starts
off, he watches in its flow the river of vitality, so majestic and
so brilliant. He admires the eternal beauty and the astonishing
harmony of life in great cities, a harmony maintained in so
providential a way in the tumult of human liberty. He contemplates
the landscapes of the great city, landscapes of stone caressed by
the mist or struck by the blows of the sun. He enjoys the fine
carriages, the fiery horses, the shining neatness of the grooms,
the dexterity of the valets, the walk of the gliding women, of the
beautiful children, happy that they are alive and dressed; in a
word, he enjoys the universal life. If a fashion, the cut of a
piece of clothing has been slightly changed, if bunches of ribbon
or buckles have been displaced by cockades, if the bonnet is larger
and the back hair a notch lower on the neck, if the waist is higher
and the skirt fuller, be sure that his eagle eye will see it at an
enormous distance. A regiment passes, going perhaps to the end of
the earth, throwing into the air of the boulevards the flourish of
trumpets compelling and light as hope; the eye of Mr. G---- has
already seen, studied, analyzed the arms, the gait, the physiognomy
of the troop. Trappings, scintillations, music, firm looks, heavy
and serious mustaches, all enters pell-mell into him, and in a few
moments the resulting poem will be virtually composed. His soul is
alive with the soul of this regiment which is marching like a
single animal, the proud image of joy in obedience!</p>
<p>But evening has come. It is the strange, uncertain hour at which
the curtains of the sky are drawn and the cities are lighted. The
gas throws spots on the purple of the sunset. Honest or dishonest,
sane or mad, men say to themselves, "At last the day is at an end!"
The wise and the good-for-nothing think of pleasure, and each
hurries to the place of his choice to drink the cup of pleasure.
Mr. G---- will be the last to leave any place where the light may
blaze, where poetry may throb, where life may tingle, where music
may vibrate, where a passion may strike an attitude for his eye,
where the man of nature and the man of convention show themselves
in a strange light, where the sun lights up the rapid joys of
fallen creatures! "A day well spent," says a kind of reader whom we
all know, "any one of us has genius enough to spend a day that
way." No! Few men are gifted with the power to see; still fewer
have the power of expression. Now, at the hour when others are
asleep, this man is bent over his table, darting on his paper the
same look which a short time ago he was casting on the world,
battling with his pencil, his pen, his brush, throwing the water
out of his glass against the ceiling, wiping his pen on his
shirt,--driven, violent, active, as if he fears that his images
will escape him, a quarreler although alone,--a cudgeler of
himself. And the things he has seen are born again upon the paper,
natural and more than natural, beautiful and more than beautiful,
singular and endowed with an enthusiastic life like the soul of the
author. The phantasmagoria have been distilled from nature. All the
materials with which his memory is crowded become classified,
orderly, harmonious, and undergo that compulsory idealization which
is the result of a childlike perception, that is to say, of a
perception that is keen, magical by force of ingenuousness.</p>
<br>
<a name="BAUDELAIRE_09"></a>
<center><b>MODERNNESS</b></center>
<br>
<p>Thus he goes, he runs, he seeks. What does he seek? Certainly
this man, such as I have portrayed him, this solitary, gifted with
an active imagination, always traveling through the great desert of
mankind, has a higher end than that of a mere observer, an end more
general than the fugitive pleasure of the passing event. He seeks
this thing which we may call modernness, for no better word to
express the idea presents itself. His object is to detach from
fashion whatever it may contain of the poetry in history, to draw
the eternal from the transitory. If we glance at the exhibitions of
modern pictures, we are struck with the general tendency of the
artists to dress all their subjects in ancient costumes. That is
obviously the sign of great laziness, for it is much easier to
declare that everything in the costume of a certain period is ugly
than to undertake the work of extracting from it the mysterious
beauty which may be contained in it, however slight or light it may
be. The modern is the transitory, the fleeting, the contingent, the
half of art, whose other half is the unchanging and the eternal.
There was a modernness for every ancient painter; most of the
beautiful portraits which remain to us from earlier times are
dressed in the costumes of their times. They are perfectly
harmonious, because the costumes, the hair, even the gesture, the
look and the smile (every epoch has its look and its smile), form a
whole that is entirely lifelike. You have no right to despise or
neglect this transitory, fleeting element, of which the changes are
so frequent. In suppressing it you fall by necessity into the void
of an abstract and undefinable beauty, like that of the only woman
before the fall. If instead of the costume of the epoch, which is a
necessary element, you substitute another, you create an anomaly
which can have no excuse unless it is a burlesque called for by the
vogue of the moment. Thus, the goddesses, the nymphs, the sultans
of the eighteenth century are portraits morally accurate.</p>

<center><b>FROM 'LITTLE POEMS IN PROSE'</b></center>
<br>
<center>EVERY ONE HIS OWN CHIMERA</center>
<br>
<p>Under a great gray sky, in a great powdery plain without roads,
without grass, without a thistle, without a nettle, I met several
men who were walking with heads bowed down.</p>
<p>Each one bore upon his back an enormous Chimera, as heavy as a
bag of flour or coal, or the accoutrements of a Roman soldier.</p>
<p>But the monstrous beast was not an inert weight; on the
contrary, it enveloped and oppressed the man with its elastic and
mighty muscles; it fastened with its two vast claws to the breast
of the bearer, and its fabulous head surmounted the brow of the
man, like one of those horrible helmets by which the ancient
warriors hoped to increase the terror of the enemy.</p>
<p>I questioned one of these men, and I asked him whither they were
bound thus. He answered that he knew not, neither he nor the
others; but that evidently they were bound somewhere, since they
were impelled by an irresistible desire to go forward.</p>
<p>It is curious to note that not one of these travelers looked
irritated at the ferocious beast suspended from his neck and glued
against his back; it seemed as though he considered it as making
part of himself. None of these weary and serious faces bore witness
to any despair; under the sullen cupola of the sky, their feet
plunging into the dust of a soil as desolate as that sky, they went
their way with the resigned countenances of those who have
condemned themselves to hope forever.</p>
<p>The procession passed by me and sank into the horizon's
atmosphere, where the rounded surface of the planet slips from the
curiosity of human sight, and for a few moments I obstinately
persisted in wishing to fathom the mystery; but soon an
irresistible indifference fell upon me, and I felt more heavily
oppressed by it than even they were by their crushing Chimeras.</p>

those voluntary buffoons whose duty was to make kings laugh when
Remorse or Ennui possessed their souls, muffled in a glaring
ridiculous costume, crowned with horns and bells, and crouched
against the pedestal, raised his eyes full of tears toward the
immortal goddess. And his eyes said:--"I am the least and the most
solitary of human beings, deprived of love and of friendship, and
therefore far below the most imperfect of the animals.
Nevertheless, I am made, even I, to feel and comprehend the
immortal Beauty! Ah, goddess! have pity on my sorrow and my

dazzling than a window lighted by a candle. What one can see in the
sunlight is always less interesting than what takes place behind a
blind. In that dark or luminous hole life lives, dreams,
suffers.</p>
<p>Over the sea of roofs I see a woman, mature, already wrinkled,
always bent over something, never going out. From her clothes, her
movement, from almost nothing, I have reconstructed the history of
this woman, or rather her legend, and sometimes I tell it over to
myself in tears.</p>
<p>If it had been a poor old man I could have reconstructed his
story as easily.</p>
<p>And I go to bed, proud of having lived and suffered in lives not
my own.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may say, "Are you sure that this story is the true

But get drunk.</p>
<p>And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace, on the green grass
of a moat, in the dull solitude of your chamber, you awake with
your intoxication already lessened or gone, ask of the wind, the
wave, the star, the clock, of everything that flies, sobs, rolls,
sings, talks, what is the hour? and the wind, the wave, the star,
the bird, the clock will answer, "It is the hour to get drunk!" Not

<h2>LORD BEACONSFIELD</h2>
<h3>(1804-1881)</h3>
<center>BY ISA CARRINGTON CABELL</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-b.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>enjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, born in London,
December, 1804; died there April 19th, 1881. His paternal ancestors
were of the house of Lara, and held high rank among Hebrew-Spanish
nobles till the tribunal of Torquemada drove them from Spain to
Venice. There, proud of their race and origin, they styled
themselves, "Sons of Israel," and became merchant princes. But the
city's commerce failing, the grandfather of Benjamin Disraeli
removed to London with a diminished but comfortable fortune. His
son, Isaac Disraeli, was a well-known literary man, and the author
of 'The Curiosities of Literature.' On account of the political and
social ostracism of the Jews in England, he had all his family
baptized into the Church of England; but with Benjamin Disraeli
especially, Christianity was never more than Judaism developed. His
belief and his affections were in his own race.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-203.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Lord Beaconsfield.</b></p>
<p>Benjamin, like most Jewish youths, was educated in private
schools, and at seventeen entered a solicitor's office. At
twenty-two he published 'Vivian Grey' (London, 1826), which
readable and amusing take-off of London society gave him great and
instantaneous notoriety. Its minute descriptions of the great
world, its caricatures of well-known social and political
personages, its magnificent diction,--too magnificent to be taken
quite seriously,--excited inquiry; and the great world was amazed
to discover that the impertinent observer was not one of
themselves, but a boy in a lawyer's office. To add to the audacity,
he had conceived himself the hero of these diverting situations,
and by his cleverness had outwitted age, beauty, rank, diplomacy
itself.</p>
<p>Statesmen, poets, fine ladies, were all genuinely amused; and
the author bade fair to become a lion, when he fell ill, and was
compelled to leave England for a year or more, which he spent in
travel on the Continent and in Egypt, Nubia, and Palestine. His
visit to the birthplace of his race made an impression on him that
lasted through his life and literature. It is embodied in his
'Letters to His Sister' (London, 1843), and the autobiographical
novel 'Contarini Fleming' (1833), in which he turned his adventures
into fervid English, at a guinea a volume. But although the spirit
of poesy, in the form of a Childe Harold, stalks rampant through
the romance, there is both feeling and fidelity to nature whenever
he describes the Orient and its people. Then the bizarre, brilliant
<i>poseur</i> forgets his r&ocirc;le, and reveals his highest
aspirations.</p>
<p>When Disraeli returned to London he became the fashion.
Everybody, from the prime minister to Count D'Orsay, had read his
clever novels. The poets praised them, Lady Blessington invited him
to dine, Sir Robert Peel was "most gracious."</p>
<p>But literary success could never satisfy Disraeli's ambition: a
seat in Parliament was at the end of his rainbow. He professed
himself a radical, but he was a radical in his own sense of the
term; and like his own Sidonia, half foreigner, half looker-on, he
felt himself endowed with an insight only possible to, an outsider,
an observer without inherited prepossessions.</p>
<p>Several contemporary sketches of Disraeli at this time have been
preserved. His dress was purposed affectation; it led the beholder
to look for folly only: and when the brilliant flash came, it was
the more startling as unexpected from such a figure. Lady Dufferin
told Mr. Motley that when she met Disraeli at dinner, he wore a
black-velvet coat lined with satin, purple trousers with a gold
band running down the outside seam, a scarlet waistcoat, long lace
ruffles falling down to the tips of his fingers, white gloves with
several rings outside, and long black ringlets rippling down his
shoulders. She told him he had made a fool of himself by appearing
in such a dress, but she did not guess why it had been adopted.
Another contemporary says of him, "When duly excited, his command
of language was wonderful, his power of sarcasm unsurpassed."</p>
<p>He was busy making speeches and writing political squibs for the
next two years; for Parliament was before his eyes. "He knew," says
Froude, "he had a devil of a tongue, and was unincumbered by the
foolish form of vanity called modesty." 'Ixion in Heaven,' 'The
Infernal Marriage,' and 'Popanilla' were attempts to rival both
Lucian and Swift on their own ground. It is doubtful, however,
whether he would have risked writing 'Henrietta Temple' (1837) and
'Venetia' (1837), two ardent love stories, had he not been in debt;
for notoriety as a novelist is not always a recommendation to a
constituency.</p>
<p>In 'Henrietta' he found an opportunity to write the biography of
a lover oppressed by duns. It is a most entertaining novel even to
a reader who does not read for a new light on the great statesman,
and is remarkable as the beginning of what is now known as the
"natural" manner; a revolt, his admirers tell us, from the stilted
fashion of making love that then prevailed in novels.</p>
<p>'Venetia' is founded on the characters of Byron and Shelley, and
is amusing reading. The high-flown language incrusted with the gems
of rhetoric excites our risibilities, but it is not safe to laugh
at Disraeli; in his most diverting aspects he has a deep sense of
humor, and he who would mock at him is apt to get a whip across the
face at an unguarded moment. Mr. Disraeli laughs in his sleeve at
many things, but first of all at the reader.</p>
<p>He failed in his canvass for his seat at High Wycombe, but he
turned his failure to good account, and established a reputation
for pluck and influence. "A mighty independent personage," observed
Charles Greville, and his famous quarrel with O'Connell did him so
little harm that in 1837 he was returned for Maidstone. His first
speech was a failure. The word had gone out that he was to be put
down. At last, finding it useless to persist, he said he was not
surprised at the reception he had experienced. He had begun several
things many times and had succeeded at last. Then pausing, and
looking indignantly across the house, he exclaimed in a loud and
remarkable tone, "I will sit down now, but the time will come when
you will hear me."</p>
<p>He married the widow of his patron, Wyndham Lewis, in 1838. This
put him in possession of a fortune, and gave him the power to
continue his political career. His radicalism was a thing of the
past. He had drifted from Conservatism, with Peel for a leader, to
aristocratic socialism; and in 1844, 1845, and 1847 appeared the
Trilogy, as he styled the novels 'Coningsby,' 'Tancred,' and
'Sibyl.' Of the three, 'Coningsby' will prove the most entertaining
to the modern reader. The hero is a gentleman, and in this respect
is an improvement on Vivian Grey, for his audacity is tempered by
good breeding. The plot is slight, but the scenes are entertaining.
The famous Sidonia, the Jew financier, is a favorite with the
author, and betrays his affection and respect for race. Lord
Monmouth, the wild peer, is a rival of the "Marquis of Steyne" and
worthy of a place in 'Vanity Fair'; the political intriguers are
photographed from life, the pictures of fashionable London tickle
both the vanity and the fancy of the reader.</p>
<p>'Sibyl' is too clearly a novel with a motive to give so much
pleasure. It is a study of the contrasts between the lives of the
very rich and the hopelessly poor, and an attempt to show the
superior condition of the latter when the Catholic Church was
all-powerful in England and the king an absolute monarch.</p>
<p>'Tancred' was composed when Disraeli was under "the illusion of
a possibly regenerated aristocracy." He sends Tancred, the hero,
the heir of a ducal house, to Palestine to find the inspiration to
a true religious belief, and details his adventures with a power of
sarcasm that is seldom equaled. In certain scenes in this novel the
author rises from a mere mocker to a genuine satirist. Tancred's
interview with the bishop, in which he takes that dignitary's
religious tenets seriously; that with Lady Constance, when she
explains the "Mystery of Chaos" and shows how "the stars are formed
out of the cream of the Milky Way, a sort of celestial cheese
churned into light" the vision of the angels on Mt. Sinai, and the
celestial Sidonia who talks about the "Sublime and Solacing
Doctrine of Theocratic Equality,"--all these are passages where we
wonder whether the author sneered or blushed when he wrote.
Certainly what has since been known as the Disraelian irony stings
as we turn each page.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Disraeli had become a power in Parliament, and the
bitter opponent of Peel, under whom Catholic emancipation,
parliamentary reform, and the abrogation of the commercial system,
had been carried without conditions and almost without
mitigations.</p>
<p>Disraeli's assaults on his leader delighted the Liberals; the
country members felt indignant satisfaction at the deserved
chastisement of their betrayer. With malicious skill, Disraeli
touched one after another the weak points in a character that was
superficially vulnerable. Finally the point before the House became
Peel's general conduct. He was beaten by an overwhelming majority,
and to the hand that dethroned him descended the task of building
up the ruins of the Conservative party. Disraeli's best friends
felt this a welcome necessity. There is no example of a rise so
sudden under such conditions. His politics were as much distrusted
as his serious literary passages. But Disraeli was the single
person equal to the task. For the next twenty-five years he led the
Conservative opposition in the House of Commons, varied by short
intervals of power. He was three times Chancellor of the Exchequer,
1853, 1858, and 1859; and on Lord Derby's retirement in 1868 he
became Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In 1870, having laid aside novel-writing for twenty years, he
published 'Lothair.' It is a politico-religious romance aimed at
the Jesuits, the Fenians, and the Communists. It had an
instantaneous success, for its author was the most conspicuous
figure in Europe, but its popularity is also due to its own merits.
We are all of us snobs after a fashion and love high society. The
glory of entering the splendid portals of the real English dukes
and duchesses seems to be ours when Disraeli throws open the magic
door and ushers the reader in. The decorations do not seem tawdry,
nor the tinsel other than real. We move with pleasurable excitement
with Lothair from palace to castle, and thence to battle-field and
scenes of dark intrigue. The hint of the love affair with the
Olympian Theodora appeals to our romance; the circumventing of the
wily Cardinal and his accomplices is agreeable to the Anglo-Saxon
Protestant mind; their discomfiture, and the crowning of virtue in
the shape of a rescued Lothair married to the English Duke's
daughter with the fixed Church of England views, is what the reader
expects and prays for, and is the last privilege of the real
story-teller. That the author has thrown aside his proclivities for
Romanism as he showed them in 'Sibyl,' no more disturbs us than the
eccentricities of his politics. We do not quite give him our faith
when he is most in earnest, talking Semitic Arianism on Mt.
Sinai.</p>
<p>A peerage was offered to him in 1868. He refused it for himself,
but asked Queen Victoria to grant the honor to his wife, who became
the Countess of Beaconsfield. But in 1876 he accepted the rank and
title of Earl of Beaconsfield. The author of 'Vivian Grey' received
the title that Burke had refused.</p>
<p>His last novel, 'Endymion,' was written for the &pound;10,000
its publishers paid for it. It adds nothing to his fame, but is an
agreeable picture of fashionable London life and the struggles of a
youth to gain power and place.</p>
<p>Lord Beaconsfield put more dukes, earls, lords and ladies, more
gold and jewels, more splendor and wealth into his books than any
one else ever tried to do. But beside his Oriental delight in the
display of luxury, it is interesting to see the effect of that
Orientalism when he describes the people from whom he sprang. His
rare tenderness and genuine respect are for those of the race "that
is the aristocracy of nature, the purest race, the chosen people."
He sends all his heroes to Palestine for inspiration; wisdom dwells
in her gates. Another aristocracy, that of talent, he recognizes
and applauds. No dullard ever succeeds, no genius goes
unrewarded.</p>
<p>It is the part of the story-teller to make his story a probable
one to the listener, no matter how impossible both character and
situation. Mr. Disraeli was accredited with the faculty of
persuading himself to believe or disbelieve whatever he liked; and
did he possess the same power over his readers, these entertaining
volumes would lift him to the highest rank the novelist attains. As
it is, he does not quite succeed in creating an illusion, and we
are conscious of two lobes in the author's brain; in one sits a
sentimentalist, in the other a mocking devil.</p>

<center><b>A DAY AT EMS</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Vivian Grey'</center>
<br>
<p>"I think we'd better take a little coffee now; and then, if you
like, we'll just stroll into the REDOUTE" [continued Baron de
Konigstein].</p>
<p>In a brilliantly illuminated saloon, adorned with Corinthian
columns, and casts from some of the most famous antique statues,
assembled between nine and ten o'clock in the evening many of the
visitors at Ems. On each side of the room was placed a long, narrow
table, one of which was covered with green baize, and unattended,
while the variously colored leather surface of the other was very
closely surrounded by an interested crowd. Behind this table stood
two individuals of very different appearance. The first was a
short, thick man, whose only business was dealing certain portions
of playing cards with quick succession, one after the other; and as
the fate of the table was decided by this process, did his
companion, an extremely tall, thin man, throw various pieces of
money upon certain stakes, which were deposited by the bystanders
on different parts of the table; or, which was more often the case,
with a silver rake with a long ebony handle, sweep into a large
inclosure near him the scattered sums. This inclosure was called
the bank, and the mysterious ceremony in which these persons were
assisting was the celebrated game of <i>rouge-et-noir.</i> A deep
silence was strictly observed by those who immediately surrounded
the table; no voice was heard save that of the little, short, stout
dealer, when, without an expression of the least interest, he
seemed mechanically to announce the fate of the different colors.
No other sound was heard save the jingle of the dollars and
napoleons, and the ominous rake of the tall, thin banker. The
countenances of those who were hazarding their money were grave and
gloomy their eyes were fixed, their brows contracted, and their
lips projected; and yet there was an evident effort visible to show
that they were both easy and unconcerned. Each player held in his
hand a small piece of pasteboard, on which, with a steel pricker,
he marked the run of the cards, in order, from his observations, to
regulate his own play: the <i>rouge-et-noir</i> player imagines
that chance is not capricious. Those who were not interested in the
game promenaded in two lines within the tables; or, seated in
recesses between the pillars, formed small parties for
conversation.</p>
<p>As Vivian and the baron entered, Lady Madeleine Trevor, leaning
on the arm of an elderly man, left the room; but as she was in
earnest conversation, she did not observe them.</p>
<p>"I suppose we must throw away a dollar or two, Grey!" said the
baron, as he walked up to the table.</p>
<p>"My dear De Konigstein--one pinch--one pinch!"</p>
<p>"Ah! marquis, what fortune to-night?"</p>
<p>"Bad--bad! I have lost my napoleon: I never risk further.
There's that cursed crusty old De Trumpetson, persisting, as usual,
in his run of bad luck, because he will never give in. Trust me, my
dear De Konigstein, it'll end in his ruin; and then, if there's a
sale of his effects, I shall perhaps get the snuff-box--a-a-h!"</p>
<p>"Come, Grey; shall I throw down a couple of napoleons on joint
account? I don't care much for play myself; but I suppose at Ems we
must make up our minds to lose a few louis. Here! now for the
red--joint account, mind!"</p>
<p>"Done."</p>
<p>"There's the archduke! Let us go and make our bow; we needn't
stick at the table as if our whole soul were staked with our crown
pieces--we'll make our bow, and then return in time to know our
fate." So saying, the gentlemen walked up to the top of the
room.</p>
<p>"Why, Grey!--surely no--it cannot be--and yet it is. De
Boeffleurs, how d'ye do?" said the baron, with a face beaming with
joy, and a hearty shake of the hand. "My dear, dear fellow, how the
devil did you manage to get off so soon? I thought you were not to
be here for a fortnight: we only arrived ourselves to-day."</p>
<p>"Yes--but I've made an arrangement which I did not anticipate;
and so I posted after you immediately. Whom do you think I have
brought with me?"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Salvinski."</p>
<p>"Ah! And the count?"</p>
<p>"Follows immediately. I expect him to-morrow or next day.
Salvinski is talking to the archduke; and see, he beckons to me. I
suppose I am going to be presented."</p>
<p>The chevalier moved forward, followed by the baron and
Vivian.</p>
<p>"Any friend of Prince Salvinski I shall always have great
pleasure in having presented to me. Chevalier, I feel great
pleasure in having you presented to me! Chevalier, you ought to be
proud of the name of Frenchman. Chevalier, the French are a grand
nation. Chevalier, I have the highest respect for the French
nation."</p>
<p>"The most subtle diplomatist," thought Vivian, as he recalled to
mind his own introduction, "would be puzzled to decide to which
interest his imperial highness leans."</p>
<p>The archduke now entered into conversation with the prince, and
most of the circle who surrounded him. As his highness was
addressing Vivian, the baron let slip our hero's arm, and seizing
hold of the Chevalier de Boeffleurs, began walking up and down the
room with him, and was soon engaged in very animated conversation.
In a few minutes the archduke, bowing to his circle, made a move
and regained the side of a Saxon lady, from whose interesting
company he had been disturbed by the arrival of Prince
Salvinski--an individual of whose long stories and dull romances
the archduke had, from experience, a particular dread; but his
highness was always very courteous to the Poles.</p>
<p>"Grey, I've dispatched De Boeffleurs to the house to instruct
the servant and Ernstorff to do the impossible, in order that our
rooms may be all together. You'll be delighted with De Boeffleurs
when you know him, and I expect you to be great friends. Oh! by the
by, his unexpected arrival has quite made us forget our venture at
<i>rouge-et-noir.</i> Of course we're too late now for anything;
even if we had been fortunate, our doubled stake, remaining on the
table, is of course lost; we may as well, however, walk up." So
saying, the baron reached the table.</p>
<p>"That is your excellency's stake!--that is your excellency's
stake!" exclaimed many voices as he came up.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, my friends? what's the matter?" asked the
baron, very calmly.</p>
<p>"There's been a run on the red! there's been a run on the red!
and your excellency's stake has doubled each time. It has been
4--8--16--32--64--128--256; and now it's 512!" quickly rattled a
little thin man in spectacles, pointing at the same time to his
unparalleled line of punctures. This was one of those officious,
noisy little men, who are always ready to give you unasked
information on every possible subject, and who are never so happy
as when they are watching over the interest of some stranger, who
never thanks them for their unnecessary solicitude.</p>
<p>Vivian, in spite of his philosophy, felt the excitement and
wonder of the moment. He looked very earnestly at the baron, whose
countenance, however, remained perfectly unmoved.</p>
<p>"Grey," said he, very coolly, "it seems we're in luck."</p>
<p>"The stake's then not all your own?" very eagerly asked the
little man in spectacles.</p>
<p>"No, part of it is yours, sir," answered the baron, very
dryly.</p>
<p>"I'm going to deal," said the short, thick man behind. "Is the
board cleared?"</p>
<p>"Your excellency then allows the stake to remain?" inquired the
tall, thin banker, with affected nonchalance.</p>
<p>"Oh! certainly," said the baron, with real nonchalance.</p>
<p>"Three--eight--fourteen--twenty-four--thirty-four, Rouge
34--"</p>
<p>All crowded nearer; the table was surrounded five or six deep,
for the wonderful run of luck had got wind, and nearly the whole
room were round the table. Indeed, the archduke and Saxon lady, and
of course the silent suite, were left alone at the upper part of
the room. The tall banker did not conceal his agitation. Even the
short, stout dealer ceased to be a machine. All looked anxious
except the baron. Vivian looked at the table; his excellency
watched, with a keen eye, the little dealer. No one even breathed
as the cards descended. "Ten--twenty--" here the countenance of the
banker brightened--"twenty-two--
twenty-five--twenty-eight--thirty-one'--Noir 31. The bank's broke;
no more play to-night. The roulette table opens immediately."</p>
<p>In spite of the great interest which had been excited, nearly
the whole crowd, without waiting to congratulate the baron, rushed
to the opposite side of the room in order to secure places at the
roulette table.</p>
<p>"Put these five hundred and twelve Napoleons into a bag," said
the baron; "Grey, this is your share, and I congratulate you. With
regard to the other half, Mr. Hermann, what bills have you
got?"</p>
<p>"Two on Gogel's house of Frankfort--accepted of course--for two
hundred and fifty each, and these twelve napoleons will make it
right," said the tall banker, as he opened a large black
pocket-book, from which he took out two small bits of paper. The
baron examined them, and after having seen them indorsed, put them
calmly into his pocket, not forgetting the twelve napoleons; and
then taking Vivian's arm, and regretting extremely that he should
have the trouble of carrying such a weight, he wished Mr. Hermann a
very good-night and success at his roulette, and walked with his
companion quietly home. Thus passed a day at Ems!</p>
<br>
<a name="BEACONSFIELD_02"></a>
<center><b>THE FESTA IN THE "ALHAMBRA"</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'The Young Duke'</center>
<br>
<p>You entered the Alhambra by a Saracenic cloister, from the
ceiling of which an occasional lamp threw a gleam upon some Eastern
arms hung up against the wall. This passage led to the armory, a
room of moderate dimensions, but hung with rich contents. Many an
inlaid breastplate--many a Mameluke scimitar and Damascus
blade--many a gemmed pistol and pearl embroided saddle might there
be seen, though viewed in a subdued and quiet light. All seemed
hushed and still, and shrouded in what had the reputation of being
a palace of pleasure.</p>
<p>In this chamber assembled the expected guests. His Grace and the
Bird of Paradise arrived first, with their foreign friends. Lord
Squib and Lord Darrell, Sir Lucius Grafton, Mr. Annesley, and Mr.
Peacock Piggott followed, but not alone. There were two ladies who,
by courtesy if no other right, bore the titles of Lady Squib and
Mrs. Annesley. There was also a pseudo Lady Aphrodite Grafton.
There was Mrs. Montfort, the famous <i>blonde</i>, of a beauty
which was quite ravishing, and dignified as beautiful. Some said
(but really people say such things) that there was a talk (I never
believe anything I hear) that had not the Bird of Paradise flown in
(these foreigners pick up everything), Mrs. Montfort would have
been the Duchess of St. James. How this may be I know not; certain,
however, this superb and stately donna did not openly evince any
spleen at her more fortunate rival. Although she found herself a
guest at the Alhambra instead of being the mistress of the palace,
probably, like many other ladies, she looked upon this affair of
the singing-bird as a freak that must end--and then perhaps his
Grace, who was a charming young man, would return to his senses.
There also was her sister, a long, fair girl, who looked
sentimental, but was only silly. There was a little French actress,
like a highly finished miniature; and a Spanish <i>danseuse</i>,
tall, dusky, and lithe, glancing like a lynx, and graceful as a
jennet.</p>
<p>Having all arrived, they proceeded down a small gallery to the
banqueting-room. The doors were thrown open. Pardon me if for a
moment I do not describe the chamber; but really, the blaze affects
my sight. The room was large and lofty. It was fitted up as an
Eastern tent. The walls were hung with scarlet cloth tied up with
ropes of gold. Round the room crouched recumbent lions richly gilt,
who grasped in their paw a lance, the top of which was a colored
lamp. The ceiling was emblazoned with the Hauteville arms, and was
radiant with burnished gold. A cresset lamp was suspended from the
centre of the shield, and not only emitted an equable flow of soft
though brilliant light, but also, as the aromatic oil wasted away,
distilled an exquisite perfume.</p>
<p>The table blazed with golden plate, for the Bird of Paradise
loved splendor. At the end of the room, under a canopy and upon a
throne, the shield and vases lately executed for his Grace now
appeared. Everything was gorgeous, costly, and imposing; but there
was no pretense, save in the original outline, at maintaining the
Oriental character. The furniture was French; and opposite the
throne Canova's Hebe, by Bertolini, bounded with a golden cup from
a pedestal of <i>ormolu</i>.</p>
<p>The guests are seated; but after a few minutes the servants
withdraw. Small tables of ebony and silver, and dumb-waiters of
ivory and gold, conveniently stored, are at hand, and Spiridion
never leaves the room. The repast was most refined, most exquisite,
and most various. It was one of those meetings where all eat. When
a few persons, easy and unconstrained, unincumbered with cares, and
of dispositions addicted to enjoyment, get together at past
midnight, it is extraordinary what an appetite they evince. Singers
also are proverbially prone to gormandize; and though the Bird of
Paradise unfortunately possessed the smallest mouth in all
Singingland, it is astonishing how she pecked! But they talked as
well as feasted, and were really gay. It was amusing to
observe--that is to say, if you had been a dumb-waiter, and had
time for observation--how characteristic was the affectation of the
women. Lady Squib was witty, Mrs. Annesley refined, and the pseudo
Lady Afy fashionable. As for Mrs. Montfort, she was, as her wont,
somewhat silent but excessively sublime. The Spaniard said nothing,
but no doubt indicated the possession of Cervantic humor by the sly
calmness with which she exhausted her own waiter and pillaged her
neighbors. The little Frenchwoman scarcely ate anything, but drank
champagne and chatted, with equal rapidity and equal composure.</p>
<p>"Prince," said the duke, "I hope Madame de Harestein approves of
your trip to England?"</p>
<p>The prince only smiled, for he was of a silent disposition, and
therefore wonderfully well suited his traveling companion.</p>
<p>"Poor Madame de Harestein!" exclaimed Count Frill. "What despair
she was in when you left Vienna, my dear duke. Ah! <i>mon Dieu!</i>
I did what I could to amuse her. I used to take my guitar, and sing
to her morning and night, but without the least effect. She
certainly would have died of a broken heart, if it had not been for
the dancing-dogs."</p>
<p>"The dancing-dogs!" minced the pseudo Lady Aphrodite. "How
shocking!"</p>
<p>"Did they bite her?" asked Lady Squib, "and so inoculate her
with gayety?"</p>
<p>"Oh! the dancing-dogs, my dear ladies! everybody was mad about
the dancing-dogs. They came from Peru, and danced the mazurka in
green jackets with a <i>jabot!</i> Oh! what a <i>jabot!</i>"</p>
<p>"I dislike animals excessively," remarked Mrs. Annesley.</p>
<p>"Dislike the dancing-dogs!" said Count Frill. "Ah, my good lady,
you would have been enchanted. Even the kaiser fed them with
pistachio nuts. Oh, so pretty! delicate leetle things, soft shining
little legs, and pretty little faces! so sensible, and with such
<i>jabots!</i>"</p>
<p>"I assure you, they were excessively amusing," said the prince,
in a soft, confidential undertone to his neighbor, Mrs. Montfort,
who, admiring his silence, which she took for state, smiled and
bowed with fascinating condescension.</p>
<p>"And what else has happened very remarkable, count, since I left
you?" asked Lord Darrell.</p>
<p>"Nothing, nothing, my dear Darrell. This <i>b&ecirc;tise</i> of
a war has made us all serious. If old Clamstandt had not married
that gipsy little Dugiria, I really think I should have taken a
turn to Belgrade."</p>
<p>"You should not eat so much, poppet," drawled Charles Annesley
to the Spaniard.</p>
<p>"Why not?" said the little French lady, with great animation,
always ready to fight anybody's battle, provided she could get an
opportunity to talk. "Why not, Mr. Annesley? You never will let
anybody eat--I never eat myself, because every night, having to
talk so much, I am dry, dry, dry--so I drink, drink, drink. It is
an extraordinary thing that there is no language which makes you so
thirsty as French. I always have heard that all the southern
languages, Spanish and Italian, make you hungry."</p>
<p>"What can be the reason?" seriously asked the pseudo Lady
Afy.</p>
<p>"Because there is so much salt in it," said Lord Squib.</p>
<p>"Delia," drawled Mr. Annesley, "you look very pretty
to-night!"</p>
<p>"I am charmed to charm you, Mr. Annesley. Shall I tell you what
Lord Bon Mot said of you?"</p>
<p>"No, <i>ma mignonne</i>! I never wish to hear my own good
things."</p>
<p>"<i>Spoiled</i>, you should add," said Lady Squib, "if Bon Mot
be in the case."</p>
<p>"Lord Bon Mot is a most gentlemanly man," said Delia, indignant
at an admirer being attacked. "He always wants to be amusing.
Whenever he dines out, he comes and sits with me half an hour to
catch the air of Parisian badinage."</p>
<p>"And you tell him a variety of little things?" asked Lord Squib,
insidiously drawing out the secret tactics of Bon Mot.</p>
<p>"<i>Beaucoup, beaucoup</i>," said Delia, extending two little
white hands sparkling with gems. "If he come in ever so--how do you
call it? heavy--not that--in the domps--ah! it is that--if ever he
come in the domps, he goes out always like a
<i>souffl&eacute;e.</i>"</p>
<p>"As empty, I have no doubt," said Lady Squib.</p>
<p>"And as sweet, I have no doubt," said Lord Squib; "for Delcroix
complains sadly of your excesses, Delia."</p>
<p>"Mr. Delcroix complain of me! That, indeed, is too bad. Just
because I recommended Montmorency de Versailles to him for an
excellent customer, ever since he abuses me, merely because
Montmorency has forgot, in the hurry of going off, to pay his
little account."</p>
<p>"But he says you have got all the things," said Lord Squib,
whose great amusement was to put Delia in a passion.</p>
<p>"What of that?" screamed the little lady. "Montmorency gave them
to me."</p>
<p>"Don't make such a noise," said the Bird of Paradise. "I never
can eat when there is a noise. St. James," continued she, in a
fretful tone, "they make such a noise!"</p>
<p>"Annesley, keep Squib quiet."</p>
<p>"Delia, leave that young man alone. If Isidora would talk a
little more, and you eat a little more, I think you would be the
most agreeable little ladies I know. Poppet! put those
<i>bonbons</i> in your pocket. You should never eat sugar-plums in
company."</p>
<p>Thus talking agreeable nonsense, tasting agreeable dishes, and
sipping agreeable wines, an hour ran on. Sweetest music from an
unseen source ever and anon sounded, and Spiridion swung a censer
full of perfumes around the chamber. At length the duke requested
Count Frill to give them a song. The Bird of Paradise would never
sing for pleasure, only for fame and a slight check. The count
begged to decline, and at the same time asked for a guitar. The
signora sent for hers; and his Excellency, preluding with a
beautiful simper, gave them some slight thing to this effect:--</p>
<blockquote>Charming Bignetta! charming Bignetta!<br>
What a gay little girl is charming Bignetta!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dances, she prattles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rides and she rattles;<br>
But she always is charming--that charming Bignetta!<br>
<br>
Charming Bignetta! charming Bignetta!<br>
What a wild little witch is charming Bignetta!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she smiles I'm all
madness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she frowns I'm all
sadness;<br>
But she always is smiling--that charming Bignetta!<br>
<br>
Charming Bignetta! charming Bignetta!<br>
What a wicked young rogue is charming Bignetta!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughs at my shyness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And flirts with his
highness;<br>
Yet still she is charming--that charming Bignetta!<br>
<br>
Charming Bignetta! charming Bignetta!<br>
What a dear little girl is charming Bignetta!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Think me only a sister,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said she trembling; I kissed
her.<br>
What a charming young sister is--charming Bignetta!</blockquote>
<br>
<p>He ceased; and although</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--the
Ferrarese<br>
To choicer music chimed his gay guitar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
Este's halls,"</blockquote>
<br>
<p>as Casti himself, or rather Mr. Rose, choicely sings, yet still
his song served its purpose, for it raised a smile.</p>
<p>"I wrote that for Madame Sapiepha, at the Congress of Verona,"
said Count Frill. "It has been thought amusing."</p>
<p>"Madame Sapiepha!" exclaimed the Bird of Paradise. "What! that
pretty little woman who has such pretty caps?"</p>
<p>"The same! Ah! what caps! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> what taste! what
taste!"</p>
<p>"You like caps, then?" asked the Bird of Paradise, with a
sparkling eye.</p>
<p>"Oh! if there be anything more than other that I know most, it
is the cap. Here, <i>voici!</i>" said he, rather oddly unbuttoning
his waistcoat, "you see what lace I have got. <i>Voici!
voici!</i>"</p>
<p>"Ah! me! what lace! what lace!" exclaimed the Bird in rapture.
"St. James, look at his lace. Come here, come here, sit next me.
Let me look at that lace." She examined it with great attention,
then turned up her beautiful eyes with a fascinating smile. "<i>Ah!
c'est jolie, n'est-ce pas?</i> But you like caps. I tell you what,
you shall see my caps. Spiridion, go, <i>mon cher,</i> and tell
ma'amselle to bring my caps--all my caps, one of each set."</p>
<p>In due time entered the Swiss, with the caps--all the caps--one
of each set. As she handed them in turn to her mistress, the Bird
chirped a panegyric upon each.</p>
<p>"That is pretty, is it not--and this also? but this is my
favorite. What do you think of this border? <i>c'est belle, cette
garniture? &nbsp;et ce jabot, c'est tres s&eacute;duisant, n'est-ce
pas? Mais voici,</i><br>
the cap of Princess Lichtenstein. <i>C'est superb, c'est mon
favori.</i> But I also love very much this of the Duchesse de
Berri. She gave me the pattern herself. And after all, this
<i>cornette &agrave; petite sant&eacute;</i> of Lady Blaze is a
dear little thing; then, again, this <i>coiffe &agrave;
dentelle</i> of Lady Macaroni is quite a pet."</p>
<p>"Pass them down," said Lord Squib, "we want to look at them."
Accordingly they were passed down. Lord Squib put one on.</p>
<p>"Do I look superb, sentimental, or only pretty?" asked his
lordship. The example was contagious, and most of the caps were
appropriated. No one laughed more than their mistress, who, not
having the slightest idea of the value of money, would have given
them all away on the spot; not from any good-natured feeling, but
from the remembrance that to-morrow she might amuse half an hour
buying others.</p>
<p>While some were stealing, and she remonstrating, the duke
clapped his hands like a caliph. The curtain at the end of the
apartment was immediately withdrawn and the ball-room stood
revealed.</p>
<p>It was of the same size as the banqueting-hall. Its walls
exhibited a long perspective of gilt pilasters, the frequent piers
of which were entirely of plate looking-glass, save where
occasionally a picture had been, as it were, inlaid in its rich
frame. Here was the Titian Venus of the Tribune, deliciously copied
by a French artist; there, the Roman Fornarina, with her delicate
grace, beamed like the personification of Raphael's genius. Here
Zuleikha, living in the light and shade of that magician Guercino,
in vain summoned the passions of the blooming Hebrew; and there
Cleopatra, preparing for her last immortal hour, proved by what we
saw that Guido had been a lover.</p>
<p>The ceiling of this apartment was richly painted and richly
gilt; from it were suspended three lustres by golden cords, which
threw a softened light upon the floor of polished and curiously
inlaid woods. At the end of the apartment was an orchestra, and
here the pages, under the direction of Carlstein, offered a very
efficient domestic band.</p>
<p>Round the room waltzed the elegant revelers. Softly and slowly,
led by their host, they glided along like spirits of air; but each
time that the duke passed the musicians, the music became livelier,
and the motion more brisk, till at length you might have mistaken
them for a college of spinning dervishes. One by one, an exhausted
couple slunk away. Some threw themselves on a sofa, some
monopolized an easy-chair; but in twenty minutes all the dancers
had disappeared. At length Peacock Piggott gave a groan, which
denoted returning energy, and raised a stretching leg in air,
bringing up, though most unwittingly, on his foot one of the Bird's
sublime and beautiful caps.</p>
<p>"Halloo! Piggott, armed <i>cap au pied</i>, I see," said Lord
Squib. This joke was a signal for general resuscitation....</p>
<p>Here they lounged in different parties, 'talking on such
subjects as idlers ever fall upon; now and then plucking a
flower--now and then listening to the fountain--now and then
lingering over the distant music--and now and then strolling
through a small apartment which opened to their walks, and which
bore the title of the Temple of Gnidus. Here Canova's Venus
breathed an atmosphere of perfume and of light--that wonderful
statue whose full-charged eye is not very classical, to be
sure--but then, how true!</p>
<p>Lord Squib proposed a visit to the theatre, which he had ordered
to be lit up. To the theatre they repaired. They rambled over every
part of the house, amused themselves, to the horror of Mr.
Annesley, with a visit to the gallery, and then collected behind
the scenes. They were excessively amused with the properties; and
Lord Squib proposed they should dress themselves. Enough champagne
had been quaffed to render any proposition palatable, and in a few
minutes they were all in costume. A crowd of queens and
chambermaids, Jews and chimney-sweeps, lawyers and charleys,
Spanish dons and Irish officers, rushed upon the stage. The little
Spaniard was Almaviva, and fell into magnificent attitudes, with
her sword and plume. Lord Squib was the old woman of Brentford, and
very funny. Sir Lucius Grafton, Harlequin; and Darrell, Grimaldi.
The prince and the count, without knowing it, figured as watchmen.
Squib whispered Annesley that Sir Lucius O'Trigger might appear in
character, but was prudent enough to suppress the joke.</p>
<p>The band was summoned, and they danced quadrilles with infinite
spirit, and finished the night, at the suggestion of Lord Squib, by
breakfasting on the stage. By the time this meal was dispatched,
the purple light of morn had broken into the building, and the
ladies proposed an immediate departure. Mrs. Montfort and her
sister were sent home in one of the duke's carriages; and the
foreign guests were requested by him to be their escort. The
respective parties drove off. Two cabriolets lingered to the last,
and finally carried away the French actress and the Spanish dancer,
Lord Darrell, and Peacock Piggott; but whether the two gentlemen
went in one and two ladies in the other I cannot aver. I hope
not.</p>
<p>There was at length a dead silence, and the young duke was left
to solitude and the signora!</p>

<center><b>SQUIBS PROM 'THE YOUNG DUKE'</b></center>
<br>
<center>CHARLES ANNESLEY</center>
<br>
<p>Dandy has been voted vulgar, and beau is now the word. I doubt
whether the revival will stand; and as for the exploded title,
though it had its faults at first, the muse or Byron has made it
not only English, but classical. However, I dare say I can do
without either of these words at present. Charles Annesley could
hardly be called a dandy or a beau. There was nothing in his dress,
though some mysterious arrangement in his costume--some rare
simplicity--some curious happiness--always made it distinguished;
there was nothing, however, in his dress which could account for
the influence which he exercised over the manners of his
contemporaries. Charles Annesley was about thirty. He had inherited
from his father, a younger brother, a small estate; and though heir
to a wealthy earldom, he had never abused what the world called
"his prospects." Yet his establishments--his little house in
Mayfair--his horses--his moderate stud at Melton--were all unique,
and everything connected with him was unparalleled for its
elegance, its invention, and its refinement. But his manner was his
magic. His natural and subdued nonchalance, so different from the
assumed non-emotion of a mere dandy; his coldness of heart, which
was hereditary, not acquired; his cautious courage, and his
unadulterated self-love, had permitted him to mingle much with
mankind without being too deeply involved in the play of their
passions; while his exquisite sense of the ridiculous quickly
revealed those weaknesses to him which his delicate satire did not
spare, even while it refrained from wounding. All feared, many
admired, and none hated him. He was too powerful not to dread, too
dexterous not to admire, too superior to hate. Perhaps the great
secret of his manner was his exquisite superciliousness; a quality
which, of all, is the most difficult to manage. Even with his
intimates he was never confidential, and perpetually assumed his
public character with the private coterie which he loved to rule.
On the whole, he was unlike any of the leading men of modern days,
and rather reminded one of the fine gentlemen of our old brilliant
comedy--the Dorimants, the Bellairs, and the Mirabels.</p>
<br>
<a name="BEACONSFIELD_04"></a>
<center><b>THE FUSSY HOSTESS</b></center>
<br>
<p>Men shrink from a fussy woman. And few can aspire to regulate
the destinies of their species, even in so slight a point as an
hour's amusement, without rare powers. There is no greater sin than
to be <i>trop prononc&eacute;e</i>. A want of tact is worse than a
want of virtue. Some women, it is said, work on pretty well against
the tide without the last. I never knew one who did not sink who
ever dared to sail without the first.</p>
<p>Loud when they should be low, quoting the wrong person, talking
on the wrong subject, teasing with notice, excruciating with
attentions, disturbing a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> in
order to make up a dance; wasting eloquence in persuading a man to
participate in amusement whose reputation depends on his social
sullenness; exacting homage with a restless eye, and not permitting
the least worthy knot to be untwined without their divinityships'
interference; patronizing the meek, anticipating the slow,
intoxicating with compliment, plastering with praise that you in
return may gild with flattery; in short, energetic without
elegance, active without grace, and loquacious without wit;
mistaking bustle for style, raillery for badinage, and noise for
gayety--these are the characters who mar the very career they think
they are creating, and who exercise a fatal influence on the
destinies of all those who have the misfortune to be connected with
them.</p>
<br>
<a name="BEACONSFIELD_05"></a>
<center><b>PUBLIC SPEAKING</b></center>
<br>
<p>Eloquence is the child of Knowledge. When a mind is full, like a
wholesome river, it is also clear. Confusion and obscurity are much
oftener the results of ignorance than of inefficiency. Few are the
men who cannot express their meaning when the occasion demands the
energy; as the lowest will defend their lives with acuteness, and
sometimes even with eloquence. They are masters of their subject.
Knowledge must be gained by ourselves. Mankind may supply us with
facts; but the results, even if they agree with previous ones, must
be the work of our own mind. To make others feel, we must feel
ourselves; and to feel ourselves, we must be natural. This we can
never be when we are vomiting forth the dogmas of the schools.
Knowledge is not a mere collection of words; and it is a delusion
to suppose that thought can be obtained by the aid of any other
intellect than our own. What is repetition, by a curious mystery,
ceases to be truth, even if it were truth when it was first heard;
as the shadow in a mirror, though it move and mimic all the actions
of vitality, is not life. When a man is not speaking or writing
from his own mind, he is as insipid company as a looking-glass.
Before a man can address a popular assembly with command, he must
know something of mankind, and he can know nothing of mankind
without he knows something of himself. Self-knowledge is the
property of that man whose passions have their play, but who
ponders over their results. Such a man sympathizes by inspiration
with his kind. He has a key to every heart. He can divine, in the
flash of a single thought, all that they require, all that they
wish. Such a man speaks to their very core. All feel that a master
hand tears off the veil of cant, with which, from necessity, they
have enveloped their souls; for cant is nothing more than the
sophistry which results from attempting to account for what is
unintelligible, or to defend what is improper.</p>
<br>
<a name="BEACONSFIELD_06"></a>
<center><b>FEMALE BEAUTY</b></center>
<br>
<p>There are some sorts of beauty which defy description, and
almost scrutiny. Some faces rise upon us in the tumult of life,
like stars from out the sea, or as if they had moved out of a
picture. Our first impression is anything but fleshly. We are
struck dumb--we gasp for breath--our limbs quiver--a faintness
glides over our frame--we are awed; instead of gazing upon the
apparition, we avert the eyes, which yet will feed upon its beauty.
A strange sort of unearthly pain mixes with the intense pleasure.
And not till, with a struggle, we call back to our memory the
commonplaces of existence, can we recover our commonplace demeanor.
These, indeed, are rare visions--these, indeed, are early feelings,
when our young existence leaps with its mountain torrents; but as
the river of our life rolls on, our eyes grow dimmer, or our blood
more cold.</p>
<br>
<a name="BEACONSFIELD_07"></a>
<center><b>LOTHAIR IN PALESTINE</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Lothair'</center>
<br>
<p>A person approached Lothair by the pathway from Bethany. It was
the Syrian gentleman whom he had met at the consulate. As he was
passing Lothair, he saluted him with the grace which had been
before remarked; and Lothair, who was by nature courteous, and even
inclined a little to ceremony in his manners, especially with those
with whom he was not intimate, immediately rose, as he would not
receive such a salutation in a reclining posture.</p>
<p>"Let me not disturb you," said the stranger; "or, if we must be
on equal terms, let me also be seated, for this is a view that
never palls."</p>
<p>"It is perhaps familiar to you," said Lothair; "but with me,
only a pilgrim, its effect is fascinating, almost
overwhelming."</p>
<p>"The view of Jerusalem never becomes familiar," said the Syrian;
"for its associations are so transcendent, so various, so
inexhaustible, that the mind can never anticipate its course of
thought and feeling, when one sits, as we do now, on this immortal
mount." ...</p>
<p>"I have often wished to visit the Sea of Galilee," said
Lothair.</p>
<p>"Well, you have now an opportunity," said the Syrian: "the north
of Palestine, though it has no tropical splendor, has much variety
and a peculiar natural charm. The burst and brightness of spring
have not yet quite vanished; you would find our plains radiant with
wild-flowers, and our hills green with young crops, and though we
cannot rival Lebanon, we have forest glades among our famous hills
that when once seen are remembered."</p>
<p>"But there is something to me more interesting than the splendor
of tropical scenery," said Lothair, "even if Galilee could offer
it. I wish to visit the cradle of my faith."</p>
<p>"And you would do wisely," said the Syrian, "for there is no
doubt the spiritual nature of man is developed in this land."</p>
<p>"And yet there are persons at the present day who doubt--even
deny--the spiritual nature of man," said Lothair. "I do not, I
could not--there are reasons why I could not."</p>
<p>"There are some things I know, and some things I believe," said
the Syrian. "I know that I have a soul, and I believe that it is
immortal."</p>
<p>"It is science that, by demonstrating the insignificance of this
globe in the vast scale of creation, has led to this infidelity,"
said Lothair.</p>
<p>"Science may prove the insignificance of this globe in the scale
of creation," said the stranger, "but it cannot prove the
insignificance of man. What is the earth compared with the sun? a
molehill by a mountain; yet the inhabitants of this earth can
discover the elements of which the great orb consists, and will
probably ere long ascertain all the conditions of its being. Nay,
the human mind can penetrate far beyond the sun. There is no
relation, therefore, between the faculties of man and the scale in
creation of the planet which he inhabits."</p>
<p>"I was glad to hear you assert the other night the spiritual
nature of man in opposition to Mr. Phoebus."</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Phoebus!" said the stranger, with a smile. "He is an
old acquaintance of mine. And I must say he is very
consistent--except in paying a visit to Jerusalem. That does
surprise me. He said to me the other night the same things as he
said to me at Rome many years ago. He would revive the worship of
Nature. The deities whom he so eloquently describes and so
exquisitely delineates are the ideal personifications of the most
eminent human qualities, and chiefly the physical. Physical beauty
is his standard of excellence, and he has a fanciful theory that
moral order would be the consequence of the worship of physical
beauty; for without moral order he holds physical beauty cannot be
maintained. But the answer to Mr. Phoebus is, that his system has
been tried and has failed, and under conditions more favorable than
are likely to exist again; the worship of Nature ended in the
degradation of the human race."</p>
<p>"But Mr. Phoebus cannot really believe in Apollo and Venus,"
said Lothair. "These are phrases. He is, I suppose, what is called
a Pantheist."</p>
<p>"No doubt the Olympus of Mr. Phoebus is the creation of his
easel," replied the Syrian. "I should not, however, describe him as
a Pantheist, whose creed requires more abstraction than Mr.
Phoebus, the worshiper of Nature, would tolerate. His school never
care to pursue any investigation which cannot be followed by the
eye--and the worship of the beautiful always ends in an orgy. As
for Pantheism, it is Atheism in domino. The belief in a Creator who
is unconscious of creating is more monstrous than any dogma of any
of the churches in this city, and we have them all here."</p>
<p>"But there are people now who tell you that there never was any
creation, and therefore there never could have been a Creator,"
said Lothair.</p>
<p>"And which is now advanced with the confidence of novelty," said
the Syrian, "though all of it has been urged, and vainly urged,
thousands of years ago. There must be design, or all we see would
be without sense, and I do not believe in the unmeaning. As for the
natural forces to which all creation is now attributed, we know
they are unconscious, while consciousness is as inevitable a
portion of our existence as the eye or the hand. The conscious
cannot be derived from the unconscious. Man is divine."</p>
<p>"I wish I could assure myself of the personality of the
Creator," said Lothair. "I cling to that, but they say it is
unphilosophical."</p>
<p>"In what sense?" asked the Syrian. "Is it more unphilosophical
to believe in a personal God, omnipotent and omniscient, than in
natural forces unconscious and irresistible? Is it unphilosophical
to combine power with intelligence? Goethe, a Spinozist who did not
believe in Spinoza, said that he could bring his mind to the
conception that in the centre of space we might meet with a monad
of pure intelligence. What may be the centre of space I leave to
the d&aelig;dal imagination of the author of 'Faust'; but a monad
of pure intelligence--is that more philosophical than the truth
first revealed to man amid these everlasting hills," said the
Syrian, "that God made man in his own image?"</p>
<p>"I have often found in that assurance a source of sublime
consolation," said Lothair.</p>
<p>"It is the charter of the nobility of man," said the Syrian,
"one of the divine dogmas revealed in this land; not the invention
of councils, not one of which was held on this sacred soil,
confused assemblies first got together by the Greeks, and then by
barbarous nations in barbarous times."</p>
<p>"Yet the divine land no longer tells us divine things," said
Lothair.</p>
<p>"It may or may not have fulfilled its destiny," said the Syrian.
"'In my Father's house are many mansions,' and by the various
families of nations the designs of the Creator are accomplished.
God works by races, and one was appointed in due season and after
many developments to reveal and expound in this land the spiritual
nature of man. The Aryan and the Semite are of the same blood and
origin, but when they quitted their central land they were ordained
to follow opposite courses. Each division of the great race has
developed one portion of the double nature of humanity, till, after
all their wanderings, they met again, and, represented by their two
choicest families, the Hellenes and the Hebrews, brought together
the treasures of their accumulated wisdom, and secured the
civilization of man."</p>
<p>"Those among whom I have lived of late," said Lothair, "have
taught me to trust much in councils, and to believe that without
them there could be no foundation for the Church. I observe you do
not speak in that vein, though, like myself, you find solace in
those dogmas which recognize the relations between the created and
the Creator."</p>
<p>"There can be no religion without that recognition," said the
Syrian, "and no creed can possibly be devised without such a
recognition that would satisfy man. Why we are here, whence we
come, whither we go--these are questions which man is organically
framed and forced to ask himself, and that would not be the case if
they could not be answered. As for churches depending on councils,
the first council was held more than three centuries after the
Sermon on the Mount. We Syrians had churches in the interval; no
one can deny that. I bow before the divine decree that swept them
away from Antioch to Jerusalem, but I am not yet prepared to
transfer my spiritual allegiance to Italian popes and Greek
patriarchs. We believe that our family were among the first
followers of Jesus, and that we then held lands in Bashan which we
hold now. We had a gospel once in our district where there was some
allusion to this, and being written by neighbors, and probably at
the time, I dare say it was accurate; but the Western Churches
declared our gospel was not authentic, though why I cannot tell,
and they succeeded in extirpating it. It was not an additional
reason why we should enter into their fold. So I am content to
dwell in Galilee and trace the footsteps of my Divine Master,
musing over his life and pregnant sayings amid the mounts he
sanctified and the waters he loved so well."</p>

<h2>BEAUMARCHAIS</h2>
<h3>(1732-1799)</h3>
<center>BY BRANDER MATTHEWS</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-p.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ierre Augustin Caron was born in Paris, January 24th, 1732. He
was the son of a watchmaker, and learned his father's trade. He
invented a new escapement, and was allowed to call himself
"Clockmaker to the King"--Louis XV. At twenty-four he married a
widow, and took the name of Beaumarchais from a small fief
belonging to her. Within a year his wife died. Being a fine
musician, he was appointed instructor of the King's daughters; and
he was quick to turn to good account the influence thus acquired.
In 1764 he made a sudden trip to Spain to vindicate a sister of
his, who had been betrothed to a man called Clavijo and whom this
Spaniard had refused to marry. He succeeded in his mission, and his
own brilliant account of this characteristic episode in his career
suggested to Goethe the play of 'Clavigo.' Beaumarchais himself
brought back from Madrid a liking for things Spanish and a
knowledge of Iberian customs and character.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-227.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Beaumarchais.</b></p>
<p>He had been a watchmaker, a musician, a court official, a
speculator, and it was only when he was thirty-five that he turned
dramatist. Various French authors, Diderot especially, weary of
confinement to tragedy and comedy, the only two forms then admitted
on the French stage, were seeking a new dramatic formula in which
they might treat pathetic situations of modern life; and it is due
largely to their efforts that the modern "play" or "drama," the
story of every-day existence, has been evolved. The first dramatic
attempt of Beaumarchais was a drama called 'Eug&eacute;nie,' acted
at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais in 1767, and succeeding
just enough to encourage him to try again. The second, 'The Two
Friends,' acted in 1770, was a frank failure. For the pathetic,
Beaumarchais had little aptitude; and these two serious efforts
were of use to him only so far as their performance may have helped
him to master the many technical difficulties of the theatre.</p>
<p>Beaumarchais had married a second time in 1768, and he had been
engaged in various speculations with the financier
P&acirc;ris-Duverney. In 1770 his wife died, and so did his
associate; and he found himself soon involved in lawsuits, into the
details of which it is needless to go, but in the course of which
he published a series of memoirs, or statements of his case for the
public at large. These memoirs are among the most vigorous of all
polemical writings; they were very clever and very witty; they were
vivacious and audacious; they were unfailingly interesting; and
they were read as eagerly as the 'Letters of Junius.' Personal at
first, the suits soon became political; and part of the public
approval given to the attack of Beaumarchais on judicial injustice
was due no doubt to the general discontent with the existing order
in France. His daring conduct of his own cause made him a
personality. He was intrusted with one secret mission by Louis XV;
and when Louis XVI came to the throne, he managed to get him again
employed confidentially.</p>
<p>Not long after his two attempts at the serious drama, he had
tried to turn to account his musical faculty by writing both the
book and the score of a comic opera, which had, however, been
rejected by the Com&eacute;die-Italienne (the predecessor of the
present Op&eacute;ra Comique). After a while Beaumarchais cut out
his music and worked over his plot into a five-act comedy in prose,
'The Barber of Seville.' It was produced by the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais in 1775, and like the
contemporary 'Rivals' of Sheridan,--the one English author with
whom Beaumarchais must always be compared,--it was a failure on the
first night and a lasting success after the author had reduced it
and rearranged it. 'The Barber of Seville' was like the 'Gil Blas'
of Lesage in that, while it was seemingly Spanish in its scenes, it
was in reality essentially French. It contained one of the
strongest characters in literature,--Figaro, a reincarnation of the
intriguing servant of Menander and Plautus and Moli&egrave;re.
Simple in plot, ingenious in incident, brisk in dialogue, broadly
effective in character-drawing, 'The Barber of Seville' is the most
famous French comedy of the eighteenth century, with the single
exception of its successor from the same pen, which appeared nine
years later.</p>
<p>During those years Beaumarchais was not idle. Like Defoe, he was
always devising projects for money-making. A few months after 'The
Barber of Seville' had been acted, the American Revolution began,
and Beaumarchais was a chief agent in supplying the Americans with
arms, ammunition, and supplies. He had a cruiser of his own, Le
Fier Roderigue, which was in D'Estaing's fleet. When the
independence of the United States was recognized at last,
Beaumarchais had a pecuniary claim against the young nation which
long remained unsettled.</p>
<p>Not content with making war on his own account almost,
Beaumarchais also undertook the immense task of publishing a
complete edition of Voltaire. He also prepared a sequel to the
'Barber,' in which Figaro should be even more important, and should
serve as a mouthpiece for declamatory criticism of the social
order. But his 'Marriage of Figaro' was so full of the
revolutionary ferment that its performance was forbidden. Following
the example of Moli&egrave;re under the similar interdiction of
'Tartuffe,' Beaumarchais was untiring in arousing interest in his
unacted play, reading it himself in the houses of the great.
Finally it was authorized, and when the first performance took
place at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais in 1784, the
crush to see it was so great that three persons were stifled to
death. The new comedy was as amusing and as adroit as its
predecessor, and the hits at the times were sharper and swifter and
more frequent. How demoralized society was then may be gauged by
the fact that this disintegrating satire was soon acted by the
amateurs of the court, a chief character being impersonated by
Marie Antoinette herself.</p>
<p>The career of Beaumarchais reached its climax with the
production of the second of the Figaro plays. Afterward he wrote
the libretto for an opera, 'Tarare,' produced with Salieri's music
in 1787; the year before he had married for the third time. In a
heavy play called 'The Guilty Mother,' acted with slight success in
1790, he brought in Figaro yet once more. During the Terror he
emigrated to Holland, returning to Paris in 1796 to find his
sumptuous mansion despoiled. May 18th, 1799, he died, leaving a
fortune of $200,000, besides numerous claims against the French
nation and the United States.</p>
<p>An interesting parallel could be drawn between 'The Rivals' and
the 'School for Scandal' on the one side, and on the other 'The
Barber of Seville' and 'The Marriage of Figaro'; and there are also
piquant points of likeness between Sheridan and Beaumarchais. But
Sheridan, with all his failings, was of sterner stuff than
Beaumarchais. He had a loftier political morality, and he served
the State more loyally. Yet the two comedies of Beaumarchais are
like the two comedies of Sheridan in their incessant wit, in their
dramaturgic effectiveness, and in the histrionic opportunities they
afford. Indeed, the French comedies have had a wider audience than
the English, thanks to an Italian and a German,--to Rossini who set
'The Barber of Seville' to music, and to Mozart who did a like
service for 'The Marriage of Figaro.'</p>

<center><b>FROM 'THE BARBER OF SEVILLE'</b></center>
<br>
<center><b>OUTWITTING A GUARDIAN</b></center>
<br>
<p>[Rosina's lover, Count Almaviva, attempts to meet and converse
with her by hoodwinking Dr. Bartolo, her zealous guardian. He comes
in disguise to Bartolo's dwelling, in a room of which the scene is
laid.]</p>
<p>[<i>Enter Count Almaviva, dressed as a student</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Count [solemnly]</i>--May peace and joy abide here
evermore!</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [brusquely]</i>--Never, young sir, was wish more
&agrave;propos! What do you want?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Sir, I am one Alonzo, a bachelor of arts--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Sir, I need no instructor.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>---- ---- a pupil of Don Basilio, the organist of
the convent, who teaches music to Madame your--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [suspiciously]</i>--Basilio! Organist! Yes, I know
him. Well?</p>
<p><i>Count [aside]</i>--What a man! <i>[Aloud.]</i> He's confined
to his bed with a sudden illness.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Confined to his bed! Basilio! He's very good to
send word, for I've just seen him.</p>
<p><i>Count [aside]</i>--Oh, the devil! [<i>Aloud.</i>] When I say
to his bed, sir, it's--I mean to his room.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Whatever's the matter with him, go, if you
please.</p>
<p><i>Count [embarrassed]</i>--Sir, I was asked--Can no one hear
us?</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [aside]</i>--It's some rogue! <i>[Aloud.]</i> What's
that? No, Monsieur Mysterious, no one can hear! Speak frankly--if
you can.</p>
<p><i>Count [aside]</i>--Plague take the old rascal!
<i>[Aloud.]</i> Don Basilio asked me to tell you--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Speak louder. I'm deaf in one ear.</p>
<p><i>Count [raising his voice</i>]--Ah! quite right: he asks me to
say to you that one Count Almaviva, who was lodging on the great
square--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [frightened]</i>--Speak low, speak low.</p>
<p><i>Count [louder]</i>----moved away from there this morning. As
it was I who told him that this Count Almaviva--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Low, speak lower, I beg of you.</p>
<p><i>Count [in the same tone</i>]--Was in this city, and as I have
discovered that Se&ntilde;orita Rosina has been writing to
him--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Has been writing to him? My dear friend, I
implore you, <i>do</i> speak low! Come, let's sit down, let's have
a friendly chat. You have discovered, you say, that Rosina--</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>angrily</i>]--Certainly. Basilio, anxious about
this correspondence on your account, asked me to show you her
letter; but the way you take things--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Good Lord! I take them well enough. But can't
you possibly speak a little lower?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--You told me you were deaf in one ear.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon, if I've
been surly and suspicious, Signor Alonzo: I'm surrounded with
spies--and then your figure, your age, your whole air--I beg your
pardon. Well? Have you the letter?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--I'm glad you're barely civil at last, sir. But are
you quite sure no one can overhear us?</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Not a soul. My servants are all tired out.
Se&ntilde;orita Rosina has shut herself up in a rage! The very
devil's to pay in this house. Still I'll go and make sure. [<i>He
goes to peep into Rosina's room</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>aside</i>]--Well, I've caught myself now in my
own trap. Now what shall I do about the letter? If I were to run
off?--but then I might just as well not have come. Shall I show it
to him? If I could only warn Rosina beforehand! To show it would be
a master-stroke.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i> [<i>returning on tiptoe</i>]--She's sitting by
the window with her back to the door, and re-reading a cousin's
letter which I opened. Now, now--let me see hers.</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>handing him Rosina's letter</i>]--Here it is.
[<i>Aside.</i>] She's re-reading <i>my</i> letter.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i> [<i>reads quickly</i>]--"Since you have told me
your name and estate--" Ah, the little traitress! Yes, it's her
writing.</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>frightened</i>]--Speak low yourself, won't
you?</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--What for, if you please?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--When we've finished, you can do as you choose. But
after all, Don Basilio's negotiation with a lawyer--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--With a lawyer? About my marriage?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Would I have stopped you for anything else? He
told me to say that all can be ready to-morrow. Then, if she
resists--</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--She will.</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>wants to take back the letter; Bartolo clutches
it</i>]--I'll tell you what we'll do. We will show her her letter;
and then, if necessary, [<i>more mysteriously</i>] I'll even tell
her that it was given to me by a woman--to whom the Count is
sacrificing her. Shame and rage may bring her to terms on the
spot.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i> [<i>laughing</i>]--Calumny, eh? My dear fellow, I
see very well now that you come from Basilio. But lest we should
seem to have planned this together, don't you think it would be
better if she'd met you before?</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>repressing a start of joy</i>]--Don Basilio
thought so, I know. But how can we manage it? It is late already.
There's not much time left.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--I will tell her you've come in his place.
Couldn't you give her a lesson?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--I'll do anything you like. But take care she
doesn't suspect. All these dodges of pretended masters are rather
old and theatrical.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--She won't suspect if I introduce you. But how
you do look! You've much more the air of a disguised lover than of
a zealous student-friend.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Really? Don't you think I can hoodwink her all the
better for that?</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--She'll never guess. She's in a horrible temper
this evening. But if she'll only see you--Her harpsichord is in
this room. Amuse yourself while you're waiting. I'll do all I can
to bring her here.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Don't say a word about the letter.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Before the right moment? It would lose all
effect if I did. It's not necessary to tell me things twice; it's
not necessary to tell me things twice. [<i>He goes.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>alone, soliloquizes</i>]--At last I've won!
Ouf! What a difficult little old imp he is! Figaro understands him.
I found myself lying, and that made me awkward; and he has eyes for
everything! On my honor, if the letter hadn't inspired me he'd have
thought me a fool!--Ah, how they are disputing in there!--What if
she refuses to come? Listen--If she won't, my coming is all thrown
away. There she is: I won't show myself at first.</p>
<p>[<i>Rosina enters</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i> [<i>angrily</i>]--There's no use talking about it,
sir. I've made up my mind. I don't want to hear anything more about
music.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--But, my child, do listen! It is Se&ntilde;or
Alonzo, the friend and pupil of Don Basilio, whom he has chosen as
one of our marriage witnesses. I'm sure that music will calm
you.</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i>--Oh! you needn't concern yourself about that; and
as for singing this evening--Where is this master you're so afraid
of dismissing? I'll settle him in a minute--and Se&ntilde;or
Basilio too. [<i>She sees her lover and exclaims</i>:] Ah!</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Eh, eh, what is the matter?</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i> [<i>pressing her hands to her heart</i>]--Ah, sir!
Ah, sir!</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--She is ill again! Se&ntilde;or Alonzo!</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i>--No, I am not ill--but as I was turning--ah!</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Did you sprain your foot, Madame?</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i>--Yes, yes, I sprained my foot! I--hurt myself
dreadfully.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--So I perceived.</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i> [<i>looking at the Count</i>]--The pain really
makes me feel faint.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--A chair--a chair there! And not a single chair
here! [<i>He goes to get one</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Ah, Rosina!</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i>--What imprudence!</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--There are a hundred things I must say to you.</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i>--He won't leave us alone.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Figaro will help us.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i> [<i>bringing an arm-chair</i>]--Wait a minute, my
child. Sit down here. She can't take a lesson this evening,
Se&ntilde;or: you must postpone it. Good-by.</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i> [<i>to the Count</i>]--No, wait; my pain is
better. [<i>To Bartolo</i>.] I feel that I've acted foolishly! I'll
imitate you, and atone at once by taking my lesson.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Oh! Such a kind little woman at heart! But after
so much excitement, my child, I can't let you make any exertion. So
good-bye, Se&ntilde;or, good-bye.</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i> [<i>to the Count</i>]--Do wait a minute! [<i>To
Bartolo</i>.] I shall think that you don't care to please me if you
won't let me show my regret by taking my lesson.</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>aside to Bartolo</i>]--I wouldn't oppose her,
if I were you.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--That settles it, my love: I am so anxious to
please you that I shall stay here all the time you are
practicing.</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i>--No, don't. I know you don't care for music.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--It <i>will</i> charm me this evening, I'm
sure.</p>
<p><i>Rosina [aside to the Count</i>]--I'm tormented to death!</p>
<p><i>Count [taking a sheet of music from the stand</i>]--Will you
sing this, Madame?</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i>--Yes, indeed--it's a very pretty thing out of the
opera 'The Useless Precaution.'</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Why do you <i>always</i> sing from 'The Useless
Precaution'?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--There is nothing newer! It's a picture of spring
in a very bright style. So if Madame wants to try it--</p>
<p><i>Rosina [looking at the Count</i>]--With pleasure. A picture
of spring is delightful! It is the youth of nature. It seems as if
the heart always feels more when winter's just over. It's like a
slave who finds liberty all the more charming after a long
confinement.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [to the Count</i>]--Always romantic ideas in her
head!</p>
<p><i>Count [in a low tone</i>]--Did you notice the
application?</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--Zounds!</p>
<p><i>[He sits down in the chair which Rosina has been occupying.
Rosina sings, during which Bartolo goes to sleep. Under cover of
the refrain the Count seizes Rosina's hand and covers it with
kisses. In her emotion she sings brokenly, and finally breaks off
altogether. The sudden silence awakens Bartolo. The Count starts
up, and Rosina quickly resumes her song</i>.]</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p><i>[Don Basilio enters. Figaro in background</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Rosina [startled, to herself</i>]--Don Basilio!</p>
<p><i>Count [aside]</i>--Good Heaven!</p>
<p><i>Figaro</i>--The devil!</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [going to meet him</i>]--Ah! welcome, Basilio. So
your accident was not very serious? Alonzo quite alarmed me about
you. He will tell you that I was just going to see you, and if he
had not detained me--</p>
<p><i>Basilio [in astonishment</i>]--Se&ntilde;or Alonzo?</p>
<p><i>Figaro [stamping his foot</i>]--Well, well! How long must I
wait? Two hours wasted already over your beard--Miserable
business!</p>
<p><i>Basilio [looking at every one in amazement</i>]--But,
gentlemen, will you please tell me--</p>
<p><i>Figaro</i>--You can talk to him after I've gone.</p>
<p><i>Basilio</i>--But still, would--</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--You'd better be quiet, Basilio. Do you think you
can inform him of anything new? I've told him that you sent me for
the music lesson instead of coming himself.</p>
<p><i>Basilio [still more astonished]</i>--The music lesson!
Alonzo!</p>
<p><i>Rosina [aside to Basilio]--Do</i> hold your tongue, can't
you?</p>
<p><i>Basilio</i>--She, too!</p>
<p><i>Count [to Bartolo]</i>--Let him know what you and I have
agreed upon.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [aside to Basilio]</i>--Don't contradict, and say
that he is not your pupil, or you will spoil everything.</p>
<p><i>Basilio</i>--Ah! Ah!</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [aloud]</i>--Indeed, Basilio, your pupil has a great
deal of talent.</p>
<p><i>Basilio [stupefied]</i>--My pupil! [<i>In a low tone</i>.] I
came to tell you that the Count has moved.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [low]</i>--I know it. Hush.</p>
<p><i>Basilio [low]</i>--Who told you?</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [low]</i>--He did, of course.</p>
<p><i>Count [low]</i>--It was I, naturally. Just listen, won't
you?</p>
<p><i>Rosina [low to Basilio]</i>--Is it so hard to keep still?</p>
<p><i>Figaro [low to Basilio]</i>--Hum! The sharper! He is
deaf!</p>
<p><i>Basilio [aside]</i>--Who the devil are they trying to deceive
here? Everybody seems to be in it!</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [aloud]</i>--Well, Basilio--about your lawyer--?</p>
<p><i>Figaro</i>--You have the whole evening to talk about the
lawyer.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [to Basilio]</i>--One word; only tell me if you are
satisfied with the lawyer.</p>
<p><i>Basilio [startled]</i>--With the lawyer?</p>
<p><i>Count [smiling]</i>--Haven't you seen the lawyer?</p>
<p><i>Basilio [impatient]</i>--Eh? No, I haven't seen the
lawyer.</p>
<p><i>Count [aside to Bartolo]</i>--Do you want him to explain
matters before her? Send him away.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo [low to the Count]</i>--You are right. [<i>To
Basilio</i>.] But what made you ill, all of a sudden?</p>
<p><i>Basilio [angrily]</i>--I don't understand you.</p>
<p><i>Count [secretly slipping a purse into his hands]</i>--Yes: he
wants to know what you are doing here, when you are so far from
well?</p>
<p><i>Figaro</i>--He's as pale as a ghost!</p>
<p><i>Basilio</i>--Ah! I understand.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Go to bed, dear Basilio. You are not at all well,
and you make us all anxious. Go to bed.</p>
<p><i>Figaro</i>--He looks quite upset. Go to bed.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--I'm sure he seems feverish. Go to bed.</p>
<p><i>Rosina</i>--Why did you come out? They say that it's
catching. Go to bed.</p>
<p><i>Basilio [in the greatest amazement]</i>--I'm to go to
bed!</p>
<p><i>All the others together</i>--Yes, you must.</p>
<p><i>Basilio [looking at them all]</i>--Indeed, I think I will
have to withdraw. I don't feel quite as well as usual.</p>
<p><i>Bartolo</i>--We'll look for you to-morrow, if you are
better.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--I'll see you soon, Basilio.</p>
<p><i>Basilio [aside]</i>--Devil take it if I understand all this!

<center><b>FROM 'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO'</b></center>
<br>
<center>OUTWITTING A HUSBAND</center>
<br>
<p>[The scene is the boudoir of young Countess Almaviva, the Rosina
of the previous selection. She is seated alone, when her clever
maid Susanna ushers in the young page Cherubino, just banished from
the house because obnoxious to the jealous Count.]</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Here's our young Captain, Madame.</p>
<p><i>Cherubino [timidly]</i>--The title is a sad reminder
that--that I must leave this delightful home and the godmother who
has been so kind--</p>
<p><i>Susanna--And</i> so beautiful!</p>
<p><i>Cherubino [sighing]</i>--Ah, yes!</p>
<p><i>Susanna [mocking his sigh]</i>--Ah, yes! Just look at his
hypocritical eyelids! Madame, make him sing his new song. [<i>She
gives it to him</i>.] Come now, my beautiful bluebird, sing
away.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Does the manuscript say who wrote
this--song?</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--The blushes of guilt betray him.</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--Madame, I--I--tremble so.</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Ta, ta, ta, ta--! Come, modest author--since you
are so commanded. Madame, I'll accompany him.</p>
<p><i>Countess [to Susanna]</i>--Take my guitar.</p>
<p><i>[Cherubino sings his ballad to the air of 'Malbrouck.' The
Countess reads the words of it from his manuscript, with an
occasional glance at him; he sometimes looks at her and sometimes
lowers his eyes as he sings. Susanna, accompanying him, watches
them both, laughing.]</i></p>
<p><i>Countess [folding the song]</i>--Enough, my boy. Thank you.
It is very good--full of feeling--</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Ah! as for feeling--this is a young man
who--well!</p>
<p><i>[Cherubino tries to stop her by catching hold of her dress.
Susanna whispers to him]</i>--Ah, you good-for-nothing! I'm going
to tell her. <i>[Aloud.]</i> Well--Captain! We'll amuse ourselves
by seeing how you look in one of my dresses!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Susanna, how <i>can</i> you go on so?</p>
<p><i>Susanna [going up to Cherubino and measuring herself with
him]</i>--He's just the right height. Off with your coat. <i>[She
draws it off.]</i></p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--But what if some one should come?</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--What if they do? We're doing no wrong. But I'll
lock the door, just the same. <i>[Locks it.]</i> I want to see him
in a woman's head-dress!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Well, you'll find my little cap in my
dressing-room on the toilet table.</p>
<p><i>[Susanna gets the cap, and then, sitting down on a stool, she
makes Cherubino kneel before her and arranges it on his
hair.]</i></p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Goodness, isn't he a pretty girl? I'm jealous.
Cherubino, you're altogether <i>too</i> pretty.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Undo his collar a little; that will give a more
feminine air. [<i>Susanna loosens his collar so as to show his
neck</i>.] Now push up his sleeves, so that the under ones show
more. [<i>While Susanna rolls up Cherubino's sleeves, the Countess
notices her lost ribbon around his wrist</i>.] What is that? My
ribbon?</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Ah! I'm very glad you've seen it, for I told him
I should tell. I should certainly have taken it away from him if
the Count hadn't come just then; for I am almost as strong as he
is.</p>
<p><i>Countess [with surprise, unrolling the ribbon]</i>--There's
blood on it!</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--Yes, I was tightening the curb of my horse
this morning, he curvetted and gave me a push with his head, and
the bridle stud grazed my arm.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I never saw a ribbon used as a bandage
before.</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Especially a <i>stolen</i> ribbon. What may all
those things be--the curb, the curvetting, the bridle stud?
[<i>Glances at his arms</i>.] What white arms he has! just like a
woman's. Madame, they are whiter than mine.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Never mind that, but run and find me some oiled
silk.</p>
<p>[<i>Susanna goes out, after humorously pushing Cherubino over so
that he falls forward on his hands. He and the Countess look at
each other for some time; then she breaks the silence</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I hope you are plucky enough. Don't show
yourself before the Count again to-day. We'll tell him to hurry up
your commission in his regiment.</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--I already have it, Madame. Basilio brought it
to me. [<i>He draws the commission from his pocket and hands it to
her</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Already! They haven't lost any time. [<i>She
opens it.</i>] Oh, in their hurry they've forgotten to add the seal
to it.</p>
<p><i>Susanna [returning with the oiled silk]</i>--Seal what?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--His commission in the regiment.</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Already?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--That's what I said.</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--And the bandage?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Oh, when you are getting my things, take a
ribbon from one of <i>your</i> caps. [<i>Susanna goes out
again</i>]</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--This ribbon is of my favorite color. I must
tell you I was greatly displeased at your taking it.</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--That one would heal me quickest.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--And--why so?</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--When a ribbon--has pressed the head,
and--touched the skin of one--</p>
<p><i>Countess [hastily]</i>--Very strange--then it can cure
wounds? I never heard that before. I shall certainly try it on the
first wound of any of--my maids--</p>
<p><i>Cherubino [sadly]</i>--I must go away from here!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--But not for always? [<i>Cherubino begins to
weep.</i>] And now you are crying! At that prediction of
Figaro?</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--I'm just where he said I'd be. [<i>Some one
knocks on the door</i>].</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Who can be knocking like that?</p>
<p><i>The Count [outside]</i>--Open the door!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Heavens! It's my husband. Where can you
hide?</p>
<p><i>The Count [outside]</i>--Open the door, I say.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--There's no one here, you see.</p>
<p><i>The Count</i>--But who are you talking to then?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--To you, I suppose. [<i>To Cherubino.</i>] Hide
yourself, quick--in the dressing-room!</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--Ah, after this morning, he'd kill me if he
found me <i>here</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>He runs into the dressing-room on the right, which is also
Susanna's room; the Countess, after locking him in and taking the
key, admits the Count.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--You don't usually lock yourself in, Madame.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I--I--was gossiping with Susanna. She's gone.
[<i>Pointing to her maid's room.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--And you seem very much agitated, Madame.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Not at all, I assure you! We were talking about
you. She's just gone--as I told you.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--I must say, Madame, you and I seem to be
surrounded by spiteful people. Just as I'm starting for a ride, I'm
handed a note which informs me that a certain person whom I suppose
far enough away is to visit you this evening.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--The bold fellow, whoever he is, will have to
come here, then; for I don't intend to leave my room to-day.</p>
<p>[<i>Something falls heavily in the dressing-room where Cherubino
is.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Ah, Madame, something dropped just then!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I didn't hear anything.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--You must be very absent-minded, then. Somebody is
in that room!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Who do you think could be there?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Madame, that is what I'm asking <i>you</i>. I have
just come in.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Probably it's Susanna wandering about.</p>
<p><i>Count [pointing]</i>--But you just told me that she went that
way.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--This way or that--I don't know which.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Very well, Madame, I must see her.--Come here,
Susanna.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--She cannot. Pray wait! She's but half dressed.
She's trying on things that I've given her for her wedding.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Dressed or not, I wish to see her at once.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I can't prevent your doing so anywhere else,
but here--</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--You may say what you choose--I <i>will</i> see
her.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I thoroughly believe you'd like to see her in
that state! but--</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Very well, Madame. If Susanna can't come out, at
least she can talk. [<i>Turning toward the dressing-room.</i>]
Susanna, are you there? Answer, I command you.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i> [<i>peremptorily</i>]--Don't answer, Susanna! I
forbid you! Sir, how can you be such a petty tyrant? Fine
suspicions, indeed!</p>
<p>[<i>Susanna slips by and hides behind the Countess's bed without
being noticed either by her or by the Count.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--They are all the easier to dispel. I can see that
it would be useless to ask you for the key, but it's easy enough to
break in the door. Here, somebody!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Will you really make yourself the
laughing-stock of the chateau for such a silly suspicion?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--- You are quite right. I shall simply force the
door myself. I am going for tools.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Sir, if your conduct were prompted by love, I'd
forgive your jealousy for the sake of the motive. But its cause is
only your vanity.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Love <i>or</i> vanity, Madame, I mean to know who
is in that room! And to guard against any tricks, I am going to
lock the door to your maid's room. You, Madame, will kindly come
with me, and without any noise, if you please. [<i>He leads her
away.</i>] As for the Susanna in the dressing-room, she will please
wait a few minutes.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i> [<i>going out with him</i>]--Sir, I assure
you--</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i> [<i>coming out from behind the bed and running to
the dressing-room</i>]--Cherubino! Open quick! It's Susanna.
[<i>Cherubino hurries out of the dressing-room.</i>] Escape--you
haven't a minute to lose!</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--Where can I go?</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--I don't know, I don't know at all! but do go
somewhere!</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i> [<i>running to the window, then coming
back</i>]--The window isn't so very high.</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i> [<i>frightened and holding him back</i>]--He'll
kill himself!</p>
<p><i>Cherubino</i>--Ah, Susie, I'd rather jump into a gulf than
put the Countess in danger. [<i>He snatches a kiss, then runs to
the window, hesitates, and finally jumps down into the
garden.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Ah! [<i>She falls fainting into an arm-chair.
Recovering slowly, she rises, and seeing Cherubino running through
the garden she comes forward panting.</i>] He's far away already!
... Little scamp! as nimble as he is handsome! [<i>She next runs to
the dressing-room.</i>] Now, Count Almaviva, knock as hard as you
like, break down the door. Plague take me if I answer you. [<i>Goes
into the dressing-room and shuts the door.</i>]</p>
<blockquote>[<i>Count and Countess return.</i>]</blockquote>
<p><i>Count</i>--Now, Madame, consider well before you drive me to
extremes.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I--I beg of you--!</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>preparing to burst open the door</i>]--You
can't cajole me now.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i> [<i>throwing herself on her knees</i>]--Then I
will open it! Here is the key.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--So it is <i>not</i> Susanna?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--No, but it's no one who should offend you.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--If it's a man I kill him! Unworthy wife! You wish
to stay shut up in your room--you shall stay in it long enough, I
promise you. <i>Now</i> I understand the note--my suspicions are
justified!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Will you listen to me one minute?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Who is in that room?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Your page.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Cherubino! The little scoundrel!--just let me
catch him! I don't wonder you were so agitated.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I--I assure you we were only planning an
innocent joke.</p>
<p>[<i>The Count snatches the key, and goes to the dressing-room
door; the Countess throws herself at his feet.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Have mercy, Count! Spare this poor child; and
although the disorder in which you will find him--</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--What, Madame? What do you mean? What disorder?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--He was just changing his coat--his neck and
arms are bare--</p>
<p>[<i>The Countess throws herself into a chair and turns away her
head.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>running to the dressing-room</i>]--Come out
here, you young villain!</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>seeing Susanna come out of the
dressing-room</i>]--Eh! Why, it <i>is</i> Susanna! [<i>Aside.</i>]
What, a lesson!</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i> [<i>mocking him</i>]--"I will kill him! I will
kill him!" Well, then, why don't you kill this mischievous
page?</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>to the Countess, who at the sight of Susanna
shows the greatest surprise</i>]--So <i>you</i> also play
astonishment, Madame?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Why shouldn't I?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--But perhaps she wasn't alone in there. I'll find
out. [<i>He goes into the dressing-room.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--- Susanna, I'm nearly dead.</p>
<p><i>Count</i> [<i>aside, as he returns</i>]--No one there! So
this time I really am wrong. [<i>To the Countess, coldly.</i>] You
excel at comedy, Madame.</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--And what about me, sir?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--And so do you.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Aren't you glad you found her instead of
Cherubino? [<i>Meaningly.</i>] You are generally pleased to come
across her.</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--Madame ought to have let you break in the doors,
call the servants--</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Yes, it's quite true--I'm at fault--I'm humiliated
enough! But why didn't you answer, you cruel girl, when I called
you?</p>
<p><i>Susanna</i>--I was dressing as well as I could--with the aid
of pins, and Madame knew why she forbade me to answer. She had her
lessons.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Why don't you help me get pardon, instead of
making me out as bad as you can?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Did I marry you to be eternally subjected to
jealousy and neglect? I mean to join the Ursulines, and--</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--But, Rosina!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I am no longer the Rosina whom you loved so
well. I am only poor Countess Almaviva, deserted wife of a madly
jealous husband.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--I assure you, Rosina, this man, this letter, had
excited me so--</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--I never gave my consent.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--What, you knew about it?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--This rattlepate Figaro, without my
sanction--</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--He did it, eh! and Basilio pretended that a
peasant brought it. Crafty wag, ready to impose on everybody!</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--You beg pardon, but you never grant pardon. If
I grant it, it shall only be on condition of a general amnesty.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Well, then, so be it. I agree. But I don't
understand how your sex can adapt itself to circumstances so
quickly and so nicely. You were certainly much agitated; and for
that matter, you are yet.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Men aren't sharp enough to distinguish between
honest indignation at unjust suspicion, and the confusion of
guilt.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--We men think we know something of politics, but we
are only children. Madame, the King ought to name you his
ambassador to London.--And now pray forget this unfortunate
business, so humiliating for me.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--For us both.</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Won't you tell me again that you forgive me?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Have I said <i>that</i>, Susanna?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Ah, say it now.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>--Do you deserve it, culprit?</p>
<p><i>Count</i>--Yes, honestly, for my repentance.</p>
<p><i>Countess [giving him her hand</i>]--How weak I am! What an
example I set you, Susanna! He'll never believe in a woman's
anger.</p>

are honorable.</p>

<p>he names of Beaumont and Fletcher," says Lowell, in his lectures
on 'Old English Dramatists,' "are as inseparably linked together as
those of Castor and Pollux. They are the double star of our
poetical firmament, and their beams are so indissolubly mingled
that it is vain to attempt any division of them that shall assign
to each his rightful share." Theirs was not that dramatic
collaboration all too common among the lesser Elizabethan
dramatists, at a time when managers, eager to satisfy a restless
public incessantly clamoring for novelty, parceled out single acts
or even scenes of a play among two or three playwrights, to put
together a more or less congruous piece of work. Beaumont and
Fletcher joined partnership, not from any outward necessity, but
inspired by a common love of their art and true congeniality of
mind. Unlike many of their brother dramatists, whom the necessities
of a lowly origin drove to seek a livelihood in writing for the
theatres, Beaumont and Fletcher were of gentle birth, and sprung
from families eminent at the bar and in the Church.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-244.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Francis Beaumont.</b></p>
<p>Beaumont was born at Grace-Dieu in Leicestershire, 1584, the son
of a chief justice. His name is first mentioned as a gentleman
commoner at Broadgate Hall, now Pembroke College, Oxford. At
sixteen he was entered a member of the Inner Temple, but the dry
facts of the law did not appeal to his romantic imagination.
Nowhere in his work does he draw upon his barrister's experience to
the extent that makes the plays of Middleton, who also knew the
Inner Temple at first hand, a storehouse of information in things
legal. His feet soon strayed, therefore, into the more congenial
fields of dramatic invention.</p>
<p>Fletcher was born in Rye, Sussex, the son of a minister who
later became Bishop of London. Giles Fletcher the Younger, and
Phineas Fletcher, both well-known poets in their day, were his
cousins. His early life is as little known as that of Beaumont, and
indeed as the lives of most of the other Elizabethan dramatists. He
was a pensioner at Benet College, now Corpus Christi, Cambridge, in
1591, and in 1593 he was "Bible-clerk" there. Then we hear nothing
of him until 'The Woman Hater' was brought out in 1607. The play
has been ascribed to Beaumont alone, to Fletcher alone, and to the
two jointly. Whoever may be the author, it is the firstling of his
dramatic muse, and worth merely a passing mention. How or when
their literary friendship began is not known; but since both were
friends of Jonson, both prefixing commendatory verses to the great
realist's play of 'The Fox,' it is fair to assume that through him
they were brought together, and that both belonged to that
brilliant circle of wits, poets, and dramatists who made famous the
gatherings at the Mermaid Inn.</p>
<p>They lived in the closest intimacy on the Bankside, near the
Globe Theatre in Southwark, sharing everything in common, even the
bed, and some say their clothing,--which is likely enough, as it
can be paralleled without going back three centuries. It is certain
that the more affluent circumstances of Beaumont tided his less
fortunate friend over many a difficulty; and the astonishing
dramatic productivity of Fletcher's later period was probably due
to Beaumont's untimely death, making it necessary for Fletcher to
rely on his pen for support.</p>
<p>In 1613 Beaumont's marriage to a Kentish heiress put an end to
the communistic bachelor establishment. He died March 6th, 1616,
not quite six weeks before Shakespeare, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey. Fletcher survived him nine years, dying of the
plague in 1625. He was buried, not by the side of the poet with
whose name his own is forever linked, but at St. Saviour's,
Southwark.</p>
<p>"A student of physiognomy," says Swinburne, "will not fail to
mark the points of likeness and of difference between the faces of
the two friends; both models of noble manhood.... Beaumont the
statelier and serener of the two, with clear, thoughtful eyes, full
arched brows, and strong aquiline nose, with a little cleft at the
tip; a grave and beautiful mouth, with full and finely curved lips;
the form of face a very pure oval, and the imperial head, with its
'fair large front' and clustering hair, set firm and carried high
with an aspect of quiet command and knightly observation. Fletcher
with more keen and fervid face, sharper in outline every way, with
an air of bright ardor and glad, fiery impatience; sanguine and
nervous, suiting the complexion and color of hair; the expression
of the eager eyes and lips almost rivaling that of a noble hound in
act to break the leash it strains at;--two heads as lordly of
feature and as expressive of aspect as any gallery of great men can
show."</p>
<p>It may not be altogether fanciful to transfer this description
of their physical bearing to their mental equipment, and draw some
conclusions as to their several endowments and their respective
share in the work that goes under their common name. Of course it
is impossible to draw hard and fast lines of demarkation, and
assign to each poet his own words. They, above all others, would
probably have resented so dogmatic a procedure, and affirmed the
dramas to be their joint offspring,--even as a child partakes of
the nature of both its parents.</p>
<p>Their plays are organic structures, with well worked-out plots
and for the most part well-sustained characters. They present a
complete fusion of the different elements contributed by each
author; never showing that agglomeration of incongruous matter so
often found among the work of the lesser playwrights, where each
hand can be singled out and held responsible for its share.
Elaborate attempts, based on verse tests, have been made to
disentangle the two threads of their poetic fabric. These attempts
show much patient analysis, and are interesting as evidences of
ingenuity; but they appeal more to the scholar than to the lover of
poetry. Yet a sympathetic reading and a comparison of the plays
professedly written by Fletcher alone, after Beaumont's death, with
those jointly produced by them in the early part of Fletcher's
career, shows the different qualities of mind that went to the
making of the work, and the individual characteristics of the men
that wrote it. Here Swinburne's eloquence gives concreteness to the
picture.</p>
<p>In the joint plays there is a surer touch, a deeper, more
pathetic note, a greater intensity of emotion; there is more tragic
pathos and passion, more strong genuine humor, nobler sentiments.
The predominance of these graver, sweeter qualities may well be
attributed to Beaumont's influence. Although a disciple of Jonson
in comedy, he was a close follower of Shakespeare in tragedy, and a
student of the rhythms and metres of Shakespeare's second
manner,--of the period that saw 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth,' and the plays
clustering around them. Too great a poet himself merely to imitate,
Beaumont yet felt the influence of that still greater poet who
swayed every one of the later dramatists, with the single exception
perhaps of Jonson. But in pure comedy, mixed with farce and
mock-heroic parody, he belongs to the school of "rare Ben."</p>
<p>Fletcher, on the other hand, is more brilliant, more rapid and
supple, readier in his resources, of more startling invention. He
has an extraordinary swiftness and fluency of speech; and no other
dramatist, not even Shakespeare, equals him in the remarkable
facility with which he reproduces in light, airy verse the
bantering conversations of the young beaux and court-gentlemen of
the time of James I. His peculiar trick of the redundant syllable
at the end of many of his lines is largely responsible in producing
this effect of ordinary speech, that yet is verse without being
prosy. There is a flavor about Fletcher's work peculiarly its own.
He created a new form of mixed comedy and dramatic romance, dealing
with the humors and mischances of men, yet possessing a romantic
coloring. He had great skill in combining his effects, and threw a
fresh charm and vividness over his fanciful world. The quality of
his genius is essentially bright and sunny, and therefore he is
best in his comic and romantic work. His tragedy, although it has
great pathos and passion, does not compel tears, nor does it subdue
by its terror. It lacks the note of inevitableness which is the
final touchstone of tragic greatness.</p>
<p>Their first joint play, 'Philaster, or Love Lies a-Bleeding,'
acted in 1608, is in its detached passages the most famous. Among
the others, 'The Maid's Tragedy,' produced about the same time, is
their finest play on its purely tragic side, although the plot is
disagreeable. 'King and No King' attracts because of the tender
character-drawing of Panthea. 'The Scornful Lady' is noteworthy as
the best exponent, outside his own work, of the school of Jonson on
its grosser side. 'The Knight of the Burning Pestle' is at once a
burlesque on knight-errantry and a comedy of manners.</p>
<p>Among the tragedies presumably produced by Fletcher alone,
'Bonduca' is one of the best, followed closely by 'The False One,'
'Valentinian,' and 'Thierry and Theodoret.' 'The Chances' and 'The
Wild Goose Chase' may be taken as examples of the whole work on its
comic side. 'The Humorous Lieutenant' is the best expression of the
faults and merits of Fletcher, whose comedies Swinburne has divided
into three groups: pure comedies, heroic or romantic dramas, and
mixed comedy and romance. To the first group belong 'Rule a Wife
and Have a Wife,' Fletcher's comic masterpiece, 'Wit without
Money,' 'The Wild Goose Chase,' 'The Chances,' 'The Noble
Gentleman.' The second group includes 'The Knight of Malta,' full
of heroic passion and Catholic devotion, 'The Pilgrim,' 'The Loyal
Subject,' 'A Wife for a Month,' 'Love's Pilgrimage,' 'The Lover's
Progress.' The third group comprises 'The Spanish Curate,'
'Monsieur Thomas,' 'The Custom of the Country,' 'The Elder
Brother,' 'The Little French Lawyer,' 'The Humorous Lieutenant,'
'Women Pleased,' 'Beggar's Bush,' 'The Fair Maid of the Inn.'</p>
<p>Fletcher had a part with Shakespeare in the 'Two Noble Kinsmen,'
and he wrote also in conjunction with Massinger, Rowley, and
others; Shirley, too, is believed to have finished some of his
plays.</p>
<p>Leaving aside Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher's plays are the
best dramatic expression of the romantic spirit of Elizabethan
England. Their luxurious, playful fancy delighted in the highly
colored, spicy tales of the Southern imagination which the
Renaissance was then bringing into England. They drew especially
upon Spanish material, and their plays are rightly interpreted only
when studied in reference to this Spanish foundation. But they are
at the same time true Englishmen, and above all true Elizabethans;
which is as much as to say that, borne along by the eager,
strenuous spirit of their time, reaching out toward new sensations
and impressions, new countries and customs, and dazzled by the
romanesque and fantastic, they took up this exotic material and
made it acceptable to the English mind. They satisfied the
curiosity of their time, and expressed its surface ideas and
longings. This accounts for their great popularity, which in their
day eclipsed even Shakespeare's, as it accounts also for their
shortcomings. They skimmed over the surface of passion, they saw
the pathos and the pity of it but not the terror; they lacked
Shakespeare's profound insight into the well-springs of human
action, and sacrificed truth of life to stage effect. They shared
with him one grave fault which is indeed the besetting sin of
dramatists, resulting in part from the necessarily curt and outline
action of the drama, in part from the love of audiences for strong
emotional effects; namely, the abrupt and unexplained moral
revolutions of their characters. Effects are too often produced
without apparent causes; a novelist has space to fill in the
blanks. The sudden contrition of the usurper in 'As You Like It' is
a familiar instance; Beaumont and Fletcher have plenty as bad.
Probably there was more of this in real life during the Middle
Ages, when most people still had much barbaric instability of
feeling and were liable to sudden revulsions of purpose, than in
our more equable society. On the other hand, virtue often suffers
needlessly and acquiescingly.</p>
<p>In their speech they indulged in much license, Fletcher
especially; he was prone to confuse right and wrong. The
strenuousness of the earlier Elizabethan age was passing away, and
the relaxing morality of Jacobean society was making its way into
literature, culminating in the entire disintegration of the time of
Charles II., which it is very shallow to lay entirely to the
Puritans. There would have been a time of great laxity had Cromwell
or the Puritan ascendancy never existed. Beaumont and Fletcher, in
their eagerness to please, took no thought of the after-effects of
their plays; morality did not enter into their scheme of life. Yet
they were not immoral, but merely unmoral. They lacked the high
seriousness that gives its permanent value to Shakespeare's tragic
work. They wrote not to embody the everlasting truths of life, as
he did; not because they were oppressed with the weight of a new
message striving for utterance; not because they were aflame with
the passion for the unattainable, as Marlowe; not to lash with the
stings of bitter mockery the follies and vices of their fellow-men,
as Ben Jonson; not primarily to make us shudder at the terrible
tragedies enacted by corrupted hearts, and the needless unending
sufferings of persecuted virtue, as Webster; nor yet to give us a
faithful picture of the different phases of life in Jacobean
London, as Dekker, Heywood, Middleton, and others. They wrote for
the very joy of writing, to give vent to their over-bubbling fancy
and their tender feeling.</p>
<p>They are lyrical and descriptive poets of the first order, with
a wonderful ease and grace of expression. The songs scattered
throughout their plays are second only to Shakespeare's. The volume
and variety of their work is astonishing. They left more than
fifty-two printed plays, and all of these show an extraordinary
power of invention; the most diverse passions, characters, and
situations enter into the work, their stories stimulate our
curiosity, and their characters appeal to our sympathies.
Especially in half-farcical, half-pathetic comedy they have no
superior; their wit and spirit here find freest play. Despite much
coarseness, their work is full of delicate sensibility, and
suffused with a romantic grace of form and a tenderness of
expression that endears them to our hearts, and makes them more
lovable than any of their brother dramatists, with the possible
exception of genial Dekker. The spirit of chivalry breathes through
their work, and the gentleman and scholar is always present. For in
contradiction to most of their fellow-workers, they were not on the
stage; they never took part in its more practical affairs either as
actors or managers; they derived the technical knowledge necessary
to a successful playwright from their intimacy with stage folk.</p>
<p>As poets, aside from their dramatic work, they occupy a
secondary place. Beaumont especially has left, beyond one or two
exquisite lyrics, little that is noteworthy, except some
commendatory verses addressed to Jonson. On the other hand,
Fletcher's 'Faithful Shepherdess,' with Jonson's 'Sad Shepherd' and
Milton's 'Comus,' form that delightful trilogy of the first
pastoral poems in the English language.</p>
<p>The popularity of Beaumont and Fletcher in the seventeenth
century, as compared to that of Shakespeare, has been
over-emphasized; for between 1623 and 1685 they have only two folio
editions, those of 1647 and 1679, as against four of Shakespeare.
Their position among the Elizabethans is unique. They did not found
a school either in comedy or tragedy. Massinger, who had more in
common with them than any other of the leading dramatists, cannot
be called their disciple; for though he worked in the same field,
he is more sober and severe, more careful in the construction of
his plots, more of a satirist and stern judge of society. With the
succeeding playwrights the decadence of the Elizabethan drama
began.</p>

Such is my mercy, that I could admit<br>
All sorts should equally approve the wit<br>
Of this thy even work, whose growing fame<br>
Shall raise thee high, and thou it, with thy name;<br>

Me to forbear to make those understand<br>
Whom thou, perhaps, hast in thy wiser doom<br>
Long since firmly resolved, shall never come<br>
To know more than they do,--I would have shown<br>
To all the world the art which thou alone<br>
Hast taught our tongue, the rules of time, of place,<br>
And other rites, delivered with the grace<br>
<br>
Of comic style, which only is fat more<br>
Than any English stage hath known before.<br>
But since our subtle gallants think it good<br>
To like of naught that may be understood,<br>
Lest they should be disproved, or have, at best,<br>
Stomachs so raw, that nothing can digest<br>
But what's obscene, or barks,--let us desire<br>
They may continue, simply to admire<br>
Fine clothes and strange words, and may live, in age<br>
To see themselves ill brought upon the stage,<br>
And like it; whilst thy bold and knowing Muse<br>
Contemns all praise, but such as thou wouldst choose.</blockquote>

Lady--Here is my Lord Philaster.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Oh, 'tis well.<br>
Withdraw yourself. <i>Exit Lady</i>.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--Madam, your messenger<br>
Made me believe you wished to speak with me.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--'Tis true, Philaster, but the words are such<br>
I have to say, and do so ill beseem<br>
The mouth of woman, that I wish them said,<br>
And yet am loath to speak them. Have you known<br>
That I have aught detracted from your worth?<br>
Have I in person wronged you? or have set<br>
My baser instruments to throw disgrace<br>
Upon your virtues?<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--Never, madam, you.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Why then should you, in such a public place,<br>
Injure a princess, and a scandal lay<br>
Upon my fortunes, famed to be so great,<br>
Calling a great part of my dowry in question?<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--Madam, this truth which I shall speak will be<br>
Foolish: but, for your fair and virtuous self,<br>
I could afford myself to have no right<br>
To any thing you wished.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Philaster, know,<br>
I must enjoy these kingdoms.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--Madam, both?<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Both, or I die; by fate, I die, Philaster,<br>
If I not calmly may enjoy them both.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--I would do much to save that noble life,<br>
Yet would be loath to have posterity<br>
Find in our stories, that Philaster gave<br>
His right unto a sceptre and a crown<br>
To save a lady's longing.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Nay, then, hear:<br>
I must and will have them, and more--<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--What more?<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Or lose that little life the gods prepared<br>
To trouble this poor piece of earth withal.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--Madam, what more?<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Turn, then, away thy face.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--No.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Do.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--I can endure it. Turn away my face!<br>
I never yet saw enemy that looked<br>
So dreadfully, but that I thought myself<br>
As great a basilisk as he; or spake<br>
So horribly, but that I thought my tongue<br>
Bore thunder underneath, as much as his;<br>
Nor beast that I could turn from: shall I then<br>
Begin to fear sweet sounds? a lady's voice,<br>
Whom I do love? Say, you would have my life:<br>
Why, I will give it you; for 'tis to me<br>
A thing so loathed, and unto you that ask<br>
Of so poor use, that I shall make no price:<br>
If you entreat, I will unmovedly hear.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Yet, for my sake, a little bend thy looks.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--I do.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Then know, I must have them and thee.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--And me?<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Thy love; without which, all the land<br>
Discovered yet will serve me for no use<br>
But to be buried in.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--Is't possible?<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--With it, it were too little to bestow<br>
On thee. Now, though thy breath do strike me dead,<br>
(Which, know, it may,) I have unript my breast.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--Madam, you are too full of noble thoughts<br>
To lay a train for this contemn&egrave;d life,<br>
Which you may have for asking: to suspect<br>
Were base, where I deserve no ill. Love you!<br>
By all my hopes I do, above my life!<br>
But how this passion should proceed from you<br>
So violently, would amaze a man<br>
That would be jealous.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--Another soul into my body shot<br>
Could not have filled me with more strength and spirit<br>
Than this thy breath. But spend not hasty time<br>
In seeking how I came thus: 'tis the gods,<br>
The gods, that make me so; and sure, our love<br>
Will be the nobler and the better blest,<br>
In that the secret justice of the gods<br>
Is mingled with it. Let us leave, and kiss:<br>
Lest some unwelcome guest should fall betwixt us,<br>
And we should part without it.<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--'Twill be ill<br>
I should abide here long.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--'Tis true: and worse<br>
You should come often. How shall we devise<br>
To hold intelligence, that our true loves,<br>
On any new occasion, may agree<br>
What path is best to tread?<br>
<br>
<i>Philaster</i>--I have a boy,<br>
Sent by the gods, I hope, to this intent,<br>
Yet not seen in the court. Hunting the buck,<br>
I found him sitting by a fountain's side,<br>
Of which he borrowed some to quench his thirst,<br>
And paid the nymph again as much in tears.<br>
A garland lay him by, made by himself<br>
Of many several flowers bred in the vale,<br>
Stuck in that mystic order that the rareness<br>
Delighted me; but ever when he turned<br>
His tender eyes upon 'em, he would weep,<br>
As if he meant to make 'em grow again.<br>
Seeing such pretty helpless innocence<br>
Dwell in his face, I asked him all his story.<br>
He told me that his parents gentle died,<br>
Leaving him to the mercy of the fields,<br>
Which gave him roots; and of the crystal springs,<br>
Which did not stop their courses; and the sun,<br>
Which still, he thanked him, yielded him his light.<br>
Then took he up his garland, and did show<br>
What every flower, as country-people hold,<br>
Did signify, and how all, ordered thus,<br>
Expressed his grief; and, to my thoughts, did read<br>
The prettiest lecture of his country-art<br>
That could be wished: so that methought I could<br>
Have studied it. I gladly entertained<br>
Him, who was glad to follow: and have got<br>
The trustiest, loving'st, and the gentlest boy<br>
That ever master kept. Him will I send<br>
To wait on you, and bear our hidden love.</blockquote>

<br>
PHILASTER--But, Bellario<br>
(For I must call thee still so), tell me why<br>
Thou didst conceal thy sex. It was a fault,<br>
A fault, Bellario, though thy other deeds<br>
Of truth outweighed it: all these jealousies<br>
Had flown to nothing, if thou hadst discovered<br>
What now we know.<br>
<br>
<i>Bellario</i>--My father oft would speak<br>
Your worth and virtue; and as I did grow<br>
More and more apprehensive, I did thirst<br>
To see the man so praised. But yet all this<br>
Was but a maiden-longing, to be lost<br>
As soon as found; till, sitting in my window,<br>
Printing my thoughts in lawn, I saw a god,<br>
I thought (but it was you), enter our gates:<br>
My blood flew out and back again, as fast<br>
As I had puffed it forth and sucked it in<br>
Like breath; then was I called away in haste<br>
To entertain you. Never was a man<br>
Heaved from a sheep-cote to a sceptre, raised<br>
So high in thoughts as I. You left a kiss<br>
Upon these lips then, which I mean to keep<br>
From you for ever; I did hear you talk,<br>
Far above singing. After you were gone,<br>
I grew acquainted with my heart, and searched<br>
What stirred it so: alas, I found it love!<br>
Yet far from lust; for, could I but have lived<br>
In presence of you, I had had my end.<br>
For this I did delude my noble father<br>
With a feigned pilgrimage, and dressed myself<br>
In habit of a boy; and, for I knew<br>
My birth no match for you, I was past hope<br>
Of having you; and, understanding well<br>
That when I made discovery of my sex<br>
I could not stay with you, I made a vow,<br>
By all the most religious things a maid<br>
Could call together, never to be known,<br>
Whilst there was hope to hide me from men's eyes.<br>
For other than I seemed, that I might ever<br>
Abide with you. Then sat I by the fount,<br>
Where first you took me up.<br>
<br>
<i>King</i>--Search out a match<br>
Within our kingdom, where and when thou wilt,<br>
And I will pay thy dowry; and thyself<br>
Wilt well deserve him.<br>
<br>
<i>Bellario</i>--Never, sir, will I<br>
Marry; it is a thing within my vow:<br>
But if I may have leave to serve the princess,<br>
To see the virtues of her lord and her,<br>
I shall have hope to live.<br>
<br>
<i>Arethusa</i>--I, Philaster,<br>
Cannot be jealous, though you had a lady<br>
Drest like a page to serve you; nor will I<br>
Suspect her living here.--Come, live with me;<br>
Live free as I do. She that loves my lord,<br>
Cursed be the wife that hates her!</blockquote>

That I should lose myself thus desperately,<br>
And none for pity show me how I wandered?<br>
There is not in the compass of the light<br>
A more unhappy creature: sure, I am monstrous;<br>
For I have done those follies, those mad mischiefs,<br>
Would dare a woman. Oh, my loaden soul,<br>
Be not so cruel to me; choke not up<br>
The way to my repentance!<br>
<br>
[<i>Enter Amintor.</i>]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
O my lord!<br>
<br>
<i>Amintor</i>--How now?<br>
<br>
<i>Evadne</i>--My much-abused lord!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[<i>Kneels.</i>]<br>
<br>
<i>Amintor</i>--This cannot be!<br>
<br>
<i>Evadne</i>--I do not kneel to live; I dare not hope it;<br>
The wrongs I did are greater. Look upon me,<br>
Though I appear with all my faults.<br>
<br>
<i>Amintor</i>--Stand up.<br>
This is a new way to beget more sorrows:<br>
Heaven knows I have too many. Do not mock me:<br>
<br>
Though I am tame, and bred up with my wrongs,<br>
Which are my foster-brothers, I may leap,<br>
Like a hand-wolf, into my natural wildness,<br>
And do an outrage: prithee, do not mock me,<br>
<br>
<i>Evadne</i>--My whole life is so leprous, it infects<br>
All my repentance. I would buy your pardon,<br>
Though at the highest set, even with my life:<br>
That slight contrition, that's no sacrifice<br>
For what I have committed.<br>
<br>
<i>Amintor</i>--Sure, I dazzle:<br>
There cannot be a faith in that foul woman,<br>
That knows no God more mighty than her mischiefs.<br>
Thou dost still worse, still number on thy faults,<br>
To press my poor heart thus. Can I believe<br>
There's any seed of virtue in that woman<br>
Left to shoot up that dares go on in sin<br>
Known, and so known as thine is? O Evadne!<br>
Would there were any safety in thy sex,<br>
That I might put a thousand sorrows off,<br>
And credit thy repentance! but I must not:<br>
Thou hast brought me to that dull calamity,<br>
To that strange misbelief of all the world<br>
And all things that are in it, that I fear<br>
I shall fall like a tree, and find my grave,<br>
Only remembering that I grieve.<br>
<br>
<i>Evadne</i>--My lord,<br>
Give me your griefs: you are an innocent,<br>
A soul as white as Heaven; let not my sins<br>
Perish your noble youth. I do not fall here<br>
To shadow by dissembling with my tears,<br>
(As all say women can,) or to make less<br>
What my hot will hath done, which Heaven and you<br>
Know to be tougher than the hand of time<br>
Can cut from man's remembrances; no, I do not;<br>
I do appear the same, the same Evadne,<br>
Drest in the shames I lived in, the same monster.<br>
But these are names of honor to what I am:<br>
I do present myself the foulest creature,<br>
Most poisonous, dangerous, and despised of men,<br>
Lerna e'er bred, or Nilus. I am hell,<br>
Till you, my dear lord, shoot your light into me,<br>
The beams of your forgiveness; I am soul-sick,<br>
And wither with the fear of one condemned,<br>
Till I have got your pardon.<br>
<br>
<i>Amintor</i>--Rise, Evadne.<br>
Those heavenly powers that put this good into thee<br>
Grant a continuance of it! I forgive thee:<br>
Make thyself worthy of it; and take heed,<br>
Take heed, Evadne, this be serious.<br>
Mock not the powers above, that can and dare<br>
Give thee a great example of their justice<br>
To all ensuing ages, if thou playest<br>
With thy repentance, the best sacrifice.<br>
<br>
<i>Evadne</i>--I have done nothing good to win belief,<br>
My life hath been so faithless. All the creatures<br>
Made for Heaven's honors have their ends, and good ones,<br>
All but the cozening crocodiles, false women:<br>
They reign here like those plagues, those killing sores,<br>
Men pray against; and when they die, like tales<br>
Ill told and unbelieved, they pass away,<br>
And go to dust forgotten. But, my lord,<br>
Those short days I shall number to my rest<br>
(As many must not see me) shall, though too late,<br>
Though in my evening, yet perceive a will,<br>
Since I can do no good, because a woman,<br>
Reach constantly at something that is near it;<br>
I will redeem one minute of my age,<br>
Or, like another Niobe, I'll weep,<br>
Till I am water.<br>
<br>
<i>Amintor</i>--I am now dissolved:<br>
My frozen soul melts. May each sin thou hast,<br>
Find a new mercy! Rise; I am at peace.<br>
<br>
[<i>Evadne rises</i>.]<br>
<br>
Hadst thou been thus, thus excellently good,<br>
Before that devil-king tempted thy frailty,<br>
Sure thou hadst made a star. Give me thy hand:<br>
From this time I will know thee; and as far<br>
As honor gives me leave, be thy Amintor.<br>
When we meet next, I will salute thee fairly,<br>
And pray the gods to give thee happy days:<br>
My charity shall go along with thee,<br>
Though my embraces must be far from thee.<br>
I should have killed thee, but this sweet repentance<br>
Locks up my vengeance: for which thus I kiss thee--<br>
<br>
[<i>Kisses her</i>.]<br>
<br>
The last kiss we must take; and would to Heaven<br>
The holy priest that gave our hands together<br>
Had given us equal virtues! Go, Evadne;<br>
The gods thus part our bodies. Have a care<br>
My honor falls no farther: I am well, then.<br>
<br>
<i>Evadne</i>--All the dear joys here, and above hereafter,<br>
Crown thy fair soul! Thus I take leave, my lord;<br>
And never shall you see the foul Evadne,<br>
Till she have tried all honored means, that may<br>
Set her in rest and wash her stains away.</blockquote>

<h2>WILLIAM BECKFORD</h2>
<h3>(1759-1844)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he translation from a defective Arabic manuscript of the 'Book
of the Thousand Nights and A Night,' first into the French by
Galland, about 1705, and presently into various English versions,
exerted an immediate influence on French, German, and English
romance. The pseudo-Oriental or semi-Oriental tale of
home-manufacture sprang into existence right and left with the
publishers of London and Paris, and in German centres of letters.
Hope's 'Anastasius, or Memoirs of a Modern Greek,' Lewis's 'The
Monk,' the German Hauff's admirable 'Stories of the Caravan, the
Inn, and the Palace,' R&uuml;ckert's 'Tales of the Genii,' and
William Beckford's 'History of the Caliph Vathek,' are among the
finest performances of the sort: productions more or less Eastern
in sentiment and in their details of local color, but independent
of direct originals in the Persian or Arabic, so far as is
conclusively known.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-269.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>William Beckford.</b></p>
<p>William Beckford, born at London in 1759 (of a strong line which
included a governor of Jamaica), dying in 1844, is a figure of
distinction merely as an Englishman of his time, aside from his one
claim to literary remembrance. His father's death left him the
richest untitled citizen of England. He was not sent to a
university, but immense care was given to his education, in which
Lord Chatham personally interested himself; and he traveled widely.
The result of this, on a very receptive mind with varied natural
gifts, was to make Beckford an ideal dilettante. His tastes in
literature, painting, music (in which Mozart was his tutor),
sculpture, architecture, and what not, were refined to the highest
nicety. He was able to gratify each of them as such a man can
rarely have the means to do. He built palaces and towers of
splendor instead of merely a beautiful country seat. He tried to
reproduce Vathek's halls in stone and stucco, employing relays of
workmen by day and night, on two several occasions and estates, for
many months. Where other men got together moderate collections of
<i>bibelots</i>, Beckford amassed whole museums. If a builder's
neglect or a fire destroyed his rarities and damaged his estates to
the extent of forty or fifty thousand pounds, Beckford merely
rebuilt and re-collected. These tastes and lavish expenditures
gradually set themselves in a current toward things Eastern. His
magnificent retreat at Cintra in Portugal, his vast Fonthill Abbey
and Lansdowne Hill estates in England, were only appanages of his
sumptuous state. England and Europe talked of him and of his
properties. He was a typical egotist: but an agreeable and gracious
man, esteemed by a circle of friends not called upon to be his
sycophants; and he kept in close touch with the intellectual life
of all Europe.</p>
<p>He wrote much, for an amateur, and in view of the tale which
does him most honor, he wrote with success. At twenty he invited
publicity with a satiric <i>jeu d'esprit,</i> 'Biographical Memoirs
of Extraordinary Painters'; and his 'Italy, with Sketches of Spain
and Portugal,' and 'Recollections of an Excursion to the
Monasteries of Alcobaba and Baltalha,' were well received. But
these books could not be expected to survive even three
generations; whereas 'Vathek,' the brilliant, the unique, the
inimitable 'Vathek,' took at once a place in literature which we
may now almost dare to call permanent. This story, not a long
one,--indeed, no more than a novelette in size,--was originally
written in French, and still lives in that language; in which an
edition, hardly the best, has lately been issued under the
editorship of M. Mallarm&eacute;. But its history is complicated by
one of the most notable acts of literary treachery and theft on
record. During the author's slow and finicky composition of it at
Lausanne, he was sending it piecemeal to his friend Robert Henley
in England for Henley to make an English version, of course to be
revised by himself. As soon as Henley had all the parts, he
published a hasty and slipshod translation, before Beckford had
seen it or was even ready to publish the French original; and not
only did so, but published it as a tale translated by himself from
a genuine Arabic original. This double violation of good faith of
course enraged Beckford, and practically separated the two men for
the rest of their lives; indeed, the wonder is that Beckford would
ever recognize Henley's existence again. The piracy was exposed and
set aside, and Beckford in self-defense issued the story himself in
French as soon as he could; indeed, he issued it in two versions
with curious and interesting differences, one published at Lausanne
and the other at Paris. The Lausanne edition is preferable.</p>
<p>'Vathek' abides to-day accredited to Beckford in both French and
English; a thing to keep his memory green as nothing else of his
work or personality will. The familiar legend that in its present
form it was composed at a single sitting, with such ardor as to
entail a severe illness, and "without the author's taking off his
clothes," cannot be reconciled with the known facts. But the
intensely vivid movement of it certainly suggests swift production;
and it could easily be thought that any author had sketched such a
story in the heat of some undisturbed sitting, and filled,
finished, and polished it at leisure. It is an extraordinary
performance; even in Henley's unsatisfactory version it is
irresistible. We know that Beckford expected to add liberally to it
by inserting sundry subordinate tales, put into the mouths of some
of the personages appearing in the last scene. It is quite as well
that he did not. Its distinctive Orientalism, perhaps less
remarkable than the unfettered imagination of its episodes, the
vividness of its characters, the easy brilliancy of its literary
manner--these things, with French diction and French wit, alternate
with startling descriptive impressiveness. It is a French
combination of Cervantes and Dante, in an Oriental and bizarre
narrative. It is not always delicate, but it is never vulgar, and
the sprightly pages are as admirable as the weird ones. Its
pictures, taken out of their connection, seem irrelevant, and are
certainly unlike enough; but they are a succession of surprises and
fascinations. Such are the famous description of the chase of
Vathek's court after the Giaour; the moonlit departure of the
Caliph for the Terrace of Istakhar; the episodes of his stay under
the roof of the Emir Fakreddin; the pursuit by Carathis on "her
great camel Alboufaki," attended by "the hideous Nerkes and the
unrelenting Cafour"; Nouronihar drawn to the magic flame in the
dell at night; the warning of the good Jinn; and the tremendous
final tableau of the Hall of Eblis.</p>
<p>The man curious in letters regards with affection the evidences
of vitality in a brief production little more than a century old;
unique in English and French literature, and occupying to-day a
high rank among the small group of <i>quasi</i>-Oriental narratives
that represent the direct workings of Galland on the Occidental
literary temperament. Today 'Vathek' surprises and delights persons
whose mental constitution puts them in touch with it, just as
potently as ever it did. And simply as a wild story, one fancies
that it will appeal quite as effectually, no matter how many
editions may be its future, to a public perhaps unsympathetic
toward its elliptical satire, its caustic wit, its fantastic course
of narrative, and its incongruous wavering between the flippant,
the grotesque, and the terrific.</p>

<center><b>THE INCANTATION AND THE SACRIFICE</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'The History of the Caliph Vathek'</center>
<br>
<p>By secret stairs, known only to herself and her son, she
[Carathis] first repaired to the mysterious recesses in which were
deposited the mummies that had been brought from the catacombs of
the ancient Pharaohs. Of these she ordered several to be taken.
From thence she resorted to a gallery, where, under the guard of
fifty female negroes, mute, and blind of the right eye, were
preserved the oil of the most venomous serpents, rhinoceros horns,
and woods of a subtle and penetrating odor, procured from the
interior of the Indies, together with a thousand other horrible
rarities. This collection had been formed for a purpose like the
present by Carathis herself, from a presentiment that she might one
day enjoy some intercourse with the infernal powers, to whom she
had ever been passionately attached, and to whose taste she was no
stranger.</p>
<p>To familiarize herself the better with the horrors in view the
Princess remained in the company of her negresses, who squinted in
the most amiable manner from the only eye they had, and leered with
exquisite delight at the skulls and skeletons which Carathis had
drawn forth from her cabinets....</p>
<p>Whilst she was thus occupied, the Caliph, who, instead of the
visions he expected, had acquired in these insubstantial regions a
voracious appetite, was greatly provoked at the negresses: for,
having totally forgotten their deafness, he had impatiently asked
them for food; and seeing them regardless of his demand, he began
to cuff, pinch, and push them, till Carathis arrived to terminate a
scene so indecent....</p>
<p>"Son! what means all this?" said she, panting for breath. "I
thought I heard as I came up, the shriek of a thousand bats,
tearing from their crannies in the recesses of a cavern.... You but
ill deserve the admirable provision I have brought you."</p>
<p>"Give it me instantly!" exclaimed the Caliph: "I am perishing
for hunger!"</p>
<p>"As to that," answered she, "you must have an excellent stomach
if it can digest what I have been preparing."</p>
<p>"Be quick," replied the Caliph. "But oh, heavens! what horrors!
What do you intend?"</p>
<p>"Come, come," returned Carathis, "be not so squeamish, but help
me to arrange everything properly, and you shall see that what you
reject with such symptoms of disgust will soon complete your
felicity. Let us get ready the pile for the sacrifice of to-night,
and think not of eating till that is performed. Know you not that
all solemn rites are preceded by a rigorous abstinence?"</p>
<p>The Caliph, not daring to object, abandoned himself to grief,
and the wind that ravaged his entrails, whilst his mother went
forward with the requisite operations. Phials of serpents' oil,
mummies, and bones were soon set in order on the balustrade of the
tower. The pile began to rise; and in three hours was as many
cubits high. At length darkness approached, and Carathis, having
stripped herself to her inmost garment, clapped her hands in an
impulse of ecstasy, and struck light with all her force. The mutes
followed her example: but Vathek, extenuated with hunger and
impatience, was unable to support himself, and fell down in a
swoon. The sparks had already kindled the dry wood; the venomous
oil burst into a thousand blue flames; the mummies, dissolving,
emitted a thick dun vapor; and the rhinoceros' horns beginning to
consume, all together diffused such a stench, that the Caliph,
recovering, started from his trance and gazed wildly on the scene
in full blaze around him. The oil gushed forth in a plenitude of
streams; and the negresses, who supplied it without intermission,
united their cries to those of the Princess. At last the fire
became so violent, and the flames reflected from the polished
marble so dazzling, that the Caliph, unable to withstand the heat
and the blaze, effected his escape, and clambered up the imperial
standard.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the inhabitants of Samarah, scared at the
light which shone over the city, arose in haste, ascended their
roofs, beheld the tower on fire, and hurried half-naked to the
square. Their love to their sovereign immediately awoke; and
apprehending him in danger of perishing in his tower, their whole
thoughts were occupied with the means of his safety. Morakanabad
flew from his retirement, wiped away his tears, and cried out for
water like the rest. Bababalouk, whose olfactory nerves were more
familiarized to magical odors, readily conjecturing that Carathis
was engaged in her favorite amusements, strenuously exhorted them
not to be alarmed. Him, however, they treated as an old poltroon;
and forbore not to style him a rascally traitor. The camels and
dromedaries were advancing with water, but no one knew by which way
to enter the tower. Whilst the populace was obstinate in forcing
the doors, a violent east wind drove such a volume of flame against
them, as at first forced them off, but afterwards rekindled their
zeal. At the same time, the stench of the horns and mummies
increasing, most of the crowd fell backward in a state of
suffocation. Those that kept their feet mutually wondered at the
cause of the smell, and admonished each other to retire.
Morakanabad, more sick than the rest, remained in a piteous
condition. Holding his nose with one hand, he persisted in his
efforts with the other to burst open the doors, and obtain
admission. A hundred and forty of the strongest and most resolute
at length accomplished their purpose....</p>
<p>Carathis, alarmed at the signs of her mutes, advanced to the
staircase, went down a few steps, and heard several voices calling
out from below:--</p>
<p>"You shall in a moment have water!"</p>
<p>Being rather alert, considering her age, she presently regained
the top of the tower, and bade her son suspend the sacrifice for
some minutes, adding:--</p>
<p>"We shall soon be enabled to render it more grateful. Certain
dolts of your subjects, imagining, no doubt, that we were on fire,
have been rash enough to break through those doors, which had
hitherto remained inviolate, for the sake of bringing up water.
They are very kind, you must allow, so soon to forget the wrongs
you have done them: but that is of little moment. Let us offer them
to the Giaour. Let them come up: our mutes, who neither want
strength nor experience, will soon dispatch them, exhausted as they
are with fatigue."</p>
<p>"Be it so," answered the Caliph, "provided we finish, and I
dine."</p>
<p>In fact, these good people, out of breath from ascending eleven
thousand stairs in such haste, and chagrined at having spilt, by
the way, the water they had taken, were no sooner arrived at the
top than the blaze of the flames and the fumes of the mummies at
once overpowered their senses. It was a pity! for they beheld not
the agreeable smile with which the mutes and the negresses adjusted
the cord to their necks: these amiable personages rejoiced,
however, no less at the scene. Never before had the ceremony of
strangling been performed with so much facility. They all fell
without the least resistance or struggle; so that Vathek, in the
space of a few moments, found himself surrounded by the dead bodies
of his most faithful subjects, all of which were thrown on the top
of the pile.</p>

<center><b>VATHEK AND NOURONIHAR IN THE HALLS OF EBLIS</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'The History of the Caliph Vathek'</center>
<br>
<p>The Caliph and Nouronihar beheld each other with amazement, at
finding themselves in a place which, though roofed with a vaulted
ceiling, was so spacious and lofty that at first they took it for
an immeasurable plain. But their eyes at length growing familiar
with the grandeur of the objects at hand, they extended their view
to those at a distance, and discovered rows of columns and arcades,
which gradually diminished till they terminated in a point, radiant
as the sun when he darts his last beams athwart the ocean; the
pavement, strewed over with gold dust and saffron, exhaled so
subtle an odor as almost overpowered them; they however went on,
and observed an infinity of censers, in which ambergris and the
wood of aloes were continually burning; between the several columns
were placed tables, each spread with a profusion of viands, and
wines of every species sparkling in vases of crystal. A throng of
genii and other fantastic spirits of each sex danced lasciviously
in troops, at the sound of music which issued from beneath.</p>
<p>In the midst of this immense hall a vast multitude was
incessantly passing, who severally kept their right hands on their
hearts, without once regarding anything around them; they had all
the livid paleness of death; their eyes, deep sunk in their
sockets, resembled those phosphoric meteors that glimmer by night
in places of interment. Some stalked slowly on, absorbed in
profound reverie; some, shrieking with agony, ran furiously about,
like tigers wounded with poisoned arrows; whilst others, grinding
their teeth in rage, foamed along, more frantic than the wildest
maniac. They all avoided each other, and though surrounded by a
multitude that no one could number, each wandered at random,
unheedful of the rest, as if alone on a desert which no foot had
trodden.</p>
<p>Vathek and Nouronihar, frozen with terror at a sight so baleful,
demanded of the Giaour what these appearances might seem, and why
these ambulating spectres never withdrew their hands from their
hearts.</p>
<p>"Perplex not yourselves," replied he bluntly, "with so much at
once; you will soon be acquainted with all: let us haste and
present you to Eblis."</p>
<p>They continued their way through the multitude; but
notwithstanding their confidence at first, they were not
sufficiently composed to examine with attention the various
perspectives of halls and of galleries that opened on the right
hand and left, which were all illuminated by torches and braziers,
whose flames rose in pyramids to the centre of the vault. At length
they came to a place where long curtains, brocaded with crimson and
gold, fell from all parts in striking confusion; here the choirs
and dances were heard no longer, the light which glimmered came
from afar.</p>
<p>After some time Vathck and Nouronihar perceived a gleam
brightening through the drapery, and entered a vast tabernacle
carpeted with the skins of leopards; an infinity of elders with
streaming beards, and Afrits in complete armor, had prostrated
themselves before the ascent of a lofty eminence, on the top of
which, upon a globe of fire, sat the formidable Eblis. His person
was that of a young man, whose noble and regular features seemed to
have been tarnished by malignant vapors; in his large eyes appeared
both pride and despair; his flowing hair retained some resemblance
to that of an angel of light; in his hand, which thunder had
blasted, he swayed the iron sceptre that causes the monster
Ouranabad, the Afrits, and all the powers of the abyss to tremble;
at his presence the heart of the Caliph sunk within him, and for
the first time he fell prostrate on his face. Nouronihar, however,
though greatly dismayed, could not help admiring the person of
Eblis; for she expected to have seen some stupendous giant. Eblis,
with a voice more mild than might be imagined, but such as
transfused through the soul the deepest melancholy, said:--</p>
<p>"Creatures of clay, I receive you into mine empire; ye are
numbered amongst my adorers. Enjoy whatever this palace affords:
the treasures of the pre-Adamite Sultans, their bickering sabres,
and those talismans that compel the Dives to open the subterranean
expanses of the mountain of Kaf, which communicate with these.
There, insatiable as your curiosity may be, shall you find
sufficient to gratify it; you shall possess the exclusive privilege
of entering the fortress of Aherman, and the halls of Argenk, where
are portrayed all creatures endowed with intelligence, and the
various animals that inhabited the earth prior to the creation of
that contemptible being whom ye denominate the Father of
Mankind."</p>
<p>Vathek and Nouronihar, feeling themselves revived and encouraged
by this harangue, eagerly said to the Giaour:--</p>
<p>"Bring us instantly to the place which contains these precious
talismans."</p>
<p>"Come!" answered this wicked Dive, with his malignant grin,
"come! and possess all that my Sovereign hath promised, and
more."</p>
<p>He then conducted them into a long aisle adjoining the
tabernacle, preceding them with hasty steps, and followed by his
disciples with the utmost alacrity. They reached at length a hall
of great extent, and covered with a lofty dome, around which
appeared fifty portals of bronze, secured with as many fastenings
of iron. A funereal gloom prevailed over the whole scene. Here,
upon two beds of incorruptible cedar, lay recumbent the fleshless
forms of the pre-Adamite kings, who had been monarchs of the whole
earth. They still possessed enough of life to be conscious of their
deplorable condition; their eyes retained a melancholy motion; they
regarded each other with looks of the deepest dejection, each
holding his right hand motionless on his heart. At their feet were
inscribed the events of their several reigns, their power, their
pride, and their crimes. Soliman Raad, Soliman Daki, and Soliman Di
Gian Ben Gian, who, after having chained up the Dives in the dark
caverns of Kaf, became so presumptuous as to doubt of the Supreme
Power,--all these maintained great state, though not to be compared
with the eminence of Soliman Ben Daoud [Solomon the son of
David].</p>
<p>This king, so renowned for his wisdom, was on the loftiest
elevation, and placed immediately under the dome; he appeared to
possess more animation than the rest, though from time to time he
labored with profound sighs, and like his companions, kept his
right hand on his heart; yet his countenance was more composed, and
he seemed to be listening to the sullen roar of a vast cataract,
visible in part through the grated portals; this was the only sound
that intruded on the silence of these doleful mansions. A range of
brazen vases surrounded the elevation.</p>
<p>"Remove the covers from these cabalistic depositaries," said the
Giaour to Vathek, "and avail thyself of the talismans, which will
break asunder all these gates of bronze, and not only render thee
master of the treasures contained within them, but also of the
spirits by which they are guarded."</p>
<p>The Caliph, whom this ominous preliminary had entirely
disconcerted, approached the vases with faltering footsteps, and
was ready to sink with terror when he heard the groans of Soliman.
As he proceeded, a voice from the livid lips of the Prophet
articulated these words:--</p>
<p>"In my lifetime I filled a magnificent throne, having on my
right hand twelve thousand seats of gold, where the patriarchs and
the prophets heard my doctrines; on my left the sages and doctors,
upon as many thrones of silver, were present at all my decisions.
Whilst I thus administered justice to innumerable multitudes, the
birds of the air librating over me served as a canopy from the rays
of the sun; my people flourished, and my palace rose to the clouds;
I erected a temple to the Most High which was the wonder of the
universe. But I basely suffered myself to be seduced by the love of
women, and a curiosity that could not be restrained by sublunary
things; I listened to the counsels of Aherman and the daughter of
Pharaoh, and adored fire and the hosts of heaven; I forsook the
holy city, and commanded the Genii to rear the stupendous palace of
Istakhar, and the terrace of the watch-towers, each of which was
consecrated to a star. There for a while I enjoyed myself in the
zenith of glory and pleasure; not only men, but supernatural
existences were subject also to my will. I began to think, as these
unhappy monarchs around had already thought, that the vengeance of
Heaven was asleep, when at once the thunder burst my structures
asunder and precipitated me hither; where however I do not remain,
like the other inhabitants, totally destitute of hope, for an angel
of light hath revealed that, in consideration of the piety of my
early youth, my woes shall come to an end when this cataract shall
for ever cease to flow. Till then I am in torments, ineffable
torments! an unrelenting fire preys on my heart."</p>
<p>Having uttered this exclamation, Soliman raised his hands
towards Heaven in token of supplication, and the Caliph discerned
through his bosom, which was transparent as crystal, his heart
enveloped in flames. At a sight so full of horror, Nouronihar fell
back like one petrified into the arms of Vathek, who cried out with
a convulsive sob:--</p>
<p>"O Giaour! whither hast thou brought us? Allow us to depart, and
I will relinquish all thou hast promised. O Mahomet! remains there
no more mercy?"</p>
<p>"None! none!" replied the malicious Dive, "Know, miserable
prince! thou art now in the abode of vengeance and despair; thy
heart also will be kindled, like those of the other votaries of
Eblis. A few days are allotted thee previous to this fatal period.
Employ them as thou wilt: recline on these heaps of gold; command
the Infernal Potentates; range at thy pleasure through these
immense subterranean domains; no barrier shall be shut against
thee. As for me, I have fulfilled my mission; I now leave thee to
thyself." At these words he vanished.</p>
<p>The Caliph and Nouronihar remained in the most abject
affliction; their tears unable to flow, scarcely could they support
themselves. At length, taking each other despondingly by the hand,
they went faltering from this fatal hall, indifferent which way
they turned their steps. Every portal opened at their approach; the
Dives fell prostrate before them; every reservoir of riches was
disclosed to their view: but they no longer felt the incentives of
curiosity, pride, or avarice. With like apathy they heard the
chorus of Genii, and saw the stately banquets prepared to regale
them. They went wandering on from chamber to chamber, hall to hall,
and gallery to gallery, all without bounds or limit, all
distinguishable by the same lowering gloom, all adorned with the
same awful grandeur, all traversed by persons in search of repose
and consolation, but who sought them in vain; for every one carried
within him a heart tormented in flames. Shunned by these various
sufferers, who seemed by their looks to be upbraiding the partners
of their guilt, they withdrew from them, to wait in direful
suspense the moment which should render them to each other the like
objects of terror.</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed Nouronihar; "will the time come when I shall
snatch my hand from thine?"</p>
<p>"Ah," said Vathek; "and shall my eyes ever cease to drink from
thine long draughts of enjoyment! Shall the moments of our
reciprocal ecstasies be reflected on with horror! It was not thou
that broughtest me hither: the principles by which Carathis
perverted my youth have been the sole cause of my perdition!"
Having given vent to these painful expressions, he called to an
Afrit, who was stirring up one of the braziers, and bade him fetch
the Princess Carathis from the palace of Samarah.</p>
<p>After issuing these orders, the Caliph and Nouronihar continued
walking amidst the silent crowd, till they heard voices at the end
of the gallery. Presuming them to proceed from some unhappy beings
who, like themselves, were awaiting their final doom, they followed
the sound, and found it to come from a small square chamber, where
they discovered sitting on sofas five young men of goodly figure,
and a lovely female, who were all holding a melancholy conversation
by the glimmering of a lonely lamp; each had a gloomy and forlorn
air, and two of them were embracing each other with great
tenderness. On seeing the Caliph and the daughter of Fakreddin
enter, they arose, saluted and gave them place; then he who
appeared the most considerable of the group addressed himself thus
to Vathek:</p>
<p>"Strangers!--who doubtless are in the same state of suspense
with ourselves, as you do not yet bear your hand on your heart,--if
you are come hither to pass the interval allotted previous to the
infliction of our common punishment, condescend to relate the
adventures that have brought you to this fatal place, and we in
return will acquaint you with ours, which deserve but too well to
be heard. We will trace back our crimes to their source, though we
are not permitted to repent; this is the only employment suited to
wretches like us!"</p>
<p>The Caliph and Nouronihar assented to the proposal, and Vathek
began, not without tears and lamentations, a sincere recital of
every circumstance that had passed. When the afflicting narrative
was closed, the young man entered on his own. Each person proceeded
in order, and when the fourth prince had reached the midst of his
adventures, a sudden noise interrupted him, which caused the vault
to tremble and to open.</p>
<p>Immediately a cloud descended, which, gradually dissipating,
discovered Carathis on the back of an Afrit, who grievously
complained of his burden. She, instantly springing to the ground,
advanced towards her son and said:--</p>
<p>"What dost thou here in this little square chamber? As the Dives
are become subject to thy beck, I expected to have found thee on
the throne of the pre-Adamite Kings."</p>
<p>"Execrable woman!" answered the Caliph; "cursed be the day thou
gavest me birth! Go, follow this Afrit, let him conduct thee to the
hall of the Prophet Soliman; there thou wilt learn to what these
palaces are destined, and how much I ought to abhor the impious
knowledge thou hast taught me."</p>
<p>"The height of power to which thou art arrived has certainly
turned thy brain," answered Carathis; "but I ask no more than
permission to show my respect for the Prophet. It is however proper
thou shouldest know that (as the Afrit has informed me neither of
us shall return to Samarah) I requested his permission to arrange
my affairs, and he politely consented: availing myself therefore of
the few moments allowed me, I set fire to the tower, and consumed
in it the mutes, negresses, and serpents which have rendered me so
much good service; nor should I have been less kind to Morakanabad,
had he not prevented me by deserting at last to my brother. As for
Bababalouk, who had the folly to return to Samarah, and all the
good brotherhood to provide husbands for thy wives, I undoubtedly
would have put them to the torture, could I but have allowed them
the time; being however in a hurry, I only hung him after having
caught him in a snare with thy wives, whilst them I buried alive by
the help of my negresses, who thus spent their last moments greatly
to their satisfaction. With respect to Dilara, who ever stood high
in my favor, she hath evinced the greatness of her mind by fixing
herself near in the service of one of the Magi, and I think will
soon be our own."</p>
<p>Vathek, too much cast down to express the indignation excited by
such a discourse, ordered the Afrit to remove Carathis from his
presence, and continued immersed in thought, which his companion
durst not disturb.</p>
<p>Carathis, however, eagerly entered the dome of Soliman, and
without regarding in the least the groans of the Prophet,
undauntedly removed the covers of the vases, and violently seized
on the talismans. Then, with a voice more loud than had hitherto
been heard within these mansions, she compelled the Dives to
disclose to her the most secret treasures, the most profound
stores, which the Afrit himself had not seen; she passed by rapid
descents known only to Eblis and his most favored potentates, and
thus penetrated the very entrails of the earth, where breathes the
Sansar, or icy wind of death. Nothing appalled her dauntless soul;
she perceived however in all the inmates, who bore their hands on
their hearts, a little singularity, not much to her taste. As she
was emerging from one of the abysses, Eblis stood forth to her
view; but notwithstanding he displayed the full effulgence of his
infernal majesty, she preserved her countenance unaltered, and even
paid her compliments with considerable firmness.</p>
<p>This superb Monarch thus answered:--"Princess, whose knowledge
and whose crimes have merited a conspicuous rank in my empire, thou
dost well to employ the leisure that remains; for the flames and
torments which are ready to seize on thy heart will not fail to
provide thee with full employment." He said this, and was lost in
the curtains of his tabernacle.</p>
<p>Carathis paused for a moment with surprise; but, resolved to
follow the advice of Eblis, she assembled all the choirs of Genii,
and all the Dives, to pay her homage; thus marched she in triumph
through a vapor of perfumes, amidst the acclamations of all the
malignant spirits, with most of whom she had formed a previous
acquaintance. She even attempted to dethrone one of the Solimans
for the purpose of usurping his place, when a voice proceeding from
the abyss of Death proclaimed, "All is accomplished!"
Instantaneously the haughty forehead of the intrepid princess was
corrugated with agony; she uttered a tremendous yell, and fixed, no
more to be withdrawn, her right hand upon her heart, which was
become a receptacle of eternal fire.</p>
<p>In this delirium, forgetting all ambitious projects and her
thirst for that knowledge which should ever be hidden from mortals,
she overturned the offerings of the Genii, and having execrated the
hour she was begotten and the womb that had borne her, glanced off
in a whirl that rendered her invisible, and continued to revolve
without intermission.</p>
<p>At almost the same instant the same voice announced to the
Caliph, Nouronihar, the five princes, and the princess, the awful
and irrevocable decree. Their hearts immediately took fire, and
they at once lost the most precious of the gifts of Heaven--Hope.
These unhappy beings recoiled with looks of the most furious
distraction; Vathek beheld in the eyes of Nouronihar nothing but
rage and vengeance, nor could she discern aught in his but aversion
and despair. The two princes who were friends, and till that moment
had preserved their attachment, shrunk back, gnashing their teeth
with mutual and unchangeable hatred. Kalilah and his sister made
reciprocal gestures of imprecation, whilst the two other princes
testified their horror for each other by the most ghastly
convulsions, and screams that could not be smothered. All severally
plunged themselves into the accursed multitude, there to wander in
an eternity of unabating anguish.</p>

<a name="BEECHER"></a>
<h2>HENRY WARD BEECHER</h2>
<h3>(1813-1887)</h3>
<center>BY LYMAN ABBOTT</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he life of Henry Ward Beecher may be either compressed into a
sentence or expanded into a volume. He was born in Litchfield,
Connecticut, on the 24th day of June, 1813, the child of the
well-known Lyman Beecher; graduated at Amherst College in 1834, and
subsequently studied at Lane Theological Seminary (Cincinnati), of
which his father was the president; began his ministerial life as
pastor of a Home Missionary (Presbyterian) church at the little
village of Lawrenceburg, twenty miles south of Cincinnati on the
Ohio River; was both sexton and pastor, swept the church, built the
fires, lighted the lamps, rang the bell, and preached the sermons;
was called to the pastorate of the First Presbyterian Church of
Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana, where he remained for eight
years, 1839 to 1847, and where his preaching soon won for him a
reputation throughout the State, and his occasional writing a
reputation beyond its boundaries; thence was called in 1847 to be
the first pastor of the newly organized Plymouth Church, Brooklyn,
where he remained with an ever increasing reputation as preacher,
lecturer, orator, and writer, until the day of his death, March
8th, 1887.</p>
<p>Such is the outline of a life, the complete story of which would
be the history of the United States during the most critical
half-century of the nation's existence. Living in an epoch when the
one overshadowing political issue was pre-eminently a moral issue,
and when no man could be a faithful preacher of righteousness and
not a political preacher; concerned in whatever concerned humanity;
believing that love is the essence of all true religion, and that
love to God is impossible without love to man; moral reformer not
less than gospel preacher, and statesman even more than theologian:
throwing himself into the anti-slavery conflict with all the
courage of a heroic nature and all the ardor of an intensely
impulsive one,--he stands among the first half-score of writers,
orators, reformers, statesmen, and soldiers, who combined to make
the half-century from 1835 to 1885 as brilliant and as heroic as
any in human history.</p>
<p>The greatness of Henry Ward Beecher consisted not so much in a
predominance of any one quality as in a remarkable combination of
many. His physique justified the well-known characterization of Mr.
Fowler, the phrenologist, "Splendid animal." He was always an eager
student, though his methods were desultory. He was familiar with
the latest thought in philosophy, had studied Herbert Spencer
before his works were republished in the United States, yet was a
child among children, and in his old age retained the
characteristic faults and virtues of childhood, and its innocent
impulsiveness.</p>
<p>His imagination might have made him a poet, his human sympathies
a dramatic poet, had not his strong common-sense kept him always in
touch with the actualities of life, and a masterful conscience
compelled him to use his &aelig;sthetic faculties in sterner
service than in the entertainment of mankind. The intensity of his
moral nature enhanced rather than subdued his exuberant humor,
which love prevented from becoming satire, and seriousness
preserved from degenerating into wit. His native faculty of mimicry
led men to call him an actor, yet he wholly lacked the essential
quality of a good actor,--power to take on another's
character,--and used the mimic art only to interpret the truth
which at the moment possessed him.</p>
<p>Such power of passion as was his is not often seen mated to such
self-control; for while he spoke with utter abandon, he rarely if
ever did so until he had carefully deliberated the cause he was
espousing. He thought himself deficient in memory, and in fact
rarely borrowed illustrations from his reading either of history or
of literature; but his keenness of observation photographed living
scenes upon an unfading memory which years after he could and did
produce at will. All these contrary elements of his strangely
composite though not incongruous character entered into his
style,--or, to speak more accurately, his styles,--and make any
analysis of them within reasonable limits difficult, if not
impossible.</p>
<p>For the writer is known by his style as the wearer by his
clothes. Even if it be no native product of the author's mind, but
a conscious imitation of carefully studied models,--what I may call
a tailor-made style, fashioned in a vain endeavor to impart
sublimity to commonplace thinking,--the poverty of the author is
thereby revealed, much as the boor is most clearly disclosed when
wearing ill-at-ease, unaccustomed broadcloth. Mr. Beecher's style
was not artificial; its faults as well as its excellences were
those of extreme naturalness. He always wrote with fury; rarely did
he correct with phlegm. His sermons were published as they fell
from his lips,--correct and revise he would not. The too few
editorials which he wrote, on the eve of the Civil War, were
written while the press was impatiently waiting for them, were
often taken page by page from his hand, and were habitually left
unread by him to be corrected in proof by others.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a href="images/illus-1714.jpg"><img src=
"images/illus-1714.jpg" width="50%" alt=""></a></p>
<br>
<p>His lighter contributions to the New York Ledger were thrown off
in the same way, generally while the messenger waited to take them
to the editorial sanctum. It was his habit, whether unconscious or
deliberate I do not know, to speak to a great congregation with the
freedom of personal conversation, and to write for the press with
as little reserve as to an intimate friend. This habit of taking
the public into his confidence was one secret of his power, but it
was also the cause of those violations of conventionality in public
address which were a great charm to some and a grave defect to
others. There are few writers or orators who have addressed such
audiences with such effect, whose style has been so true and
unmodified a reflection of their inner life. The title of one of
his most popular volumes might be appropriately made the title of
them all--'Life Thoughts.'</p>
<p>But while his style was wholly unartificial, it was no product
of mere careless genius; carelessness never gives a product worth
possessing. The excellences of Mr. Beecher's style were due to a
careful study of the great English writers; its defects to a
temperament too eager to endure the dull work of correction. In his
early manhood he studied the old English divines, not for their
thoughts, which never took hold of him, but for their style, of
which he was enamored. The best characterization of South and
Barrow I ever heard he gave me once in a casual conversation. The
great English novelists he knew; Walter Scott's novels, of which he
had several editions in his library, were great favorites with him,
but he read them rather for the beauty of their descriptive
passages than for their romantic and dramatic interest. Ruskin's
'Modern Painters' he both used himself and recommended to others as
a text-book in the observation of nature, and certain passages in
them he read and re-read.</p>
<p>But in his reading he followed the bent of his own mind rather
than any prescribed system. Neither in his public utterances nor in
his private conversation did he indicate much indebtedness to
Shakespeare among the earlier writers, nor to Emerson or Carlyle
among the moderns. Though not unfamiliar with the greatest English
poets, and the great Greek poets in translations, he was less a
reader of poetry than of poetical prose. He had, it is true, not
only read but carefully compared Dante's 'Inferno' with Milton's
'Paradise Lost'; still it was not the 'Paradise Lost,' it was the
'Areopagitica' which he frequently read on Saturday nights, for the
sublimity of its style and the inspiration it afforded to the
imagination. He was singularly deficient in verbal memory, a
deficiency which is usually accompanied by a relatively slight
appreciation of the mere rhythmic beauty of literary form. It is my
impression that for amorous poems, such as Moore's songs, or even
Shakespeare's sonnets, and for purely descriptive poetry, such as
the best of 'Childe Harold' and certain poems of Wordsworth, he
cared comparatively little.</p>
<p>But he delighted in religious poetry, whether the religion was
that of the pagan Greek Tragedies, the mediaeval Dante, or the
Puritan Milton. He was a great lover of the best hymns, and with a
catholicity of affection which included the Calvinist Toplady, the
Arminian Wesley, the Roman Catholic Faber, and the Unitarian
Holmes. Generally, however, he cared more for poetry of strength
than for that of fancy or sentiment. It was the terrific strength
in Watts's famous hymn beginning</p>
<blockquote>"My thoughts on awful subjects dwell,<br>
Damnation and the dead,"</blockquote>
<p>which caused him to include it in the 'Plymouth Collection,'
abhorrent as was the theology of that hymn alike to his heart and
to his conscience.</p>
<p>In any estimate of Mr. Beecher's style, it must be remembered
that he was both by temperament and training a preacher. He was
brought up not in a literary, but in a didactic atmosphere. If it
were as true as it is false that art exists only for art's sake,
Mr. Beecher would not have been an artist. His art always had a
purpose; generally a distinct moral purpose. An overwhelming
proportion of his contributions to literature consists of sermons
or extracts from sermons, or addresses not less distinctively
didactic. His one novel was written avowedly to rectify some common
misapprehensions as to New England life and character. Even his
lighter papers, products of the mere exuberance of a nature too
full of every phase of life to be quiescent, indicated the
intensity of a purposeful soul, much as the sparks in a
blacksmith's shop come from the very vigor with which the artisan
is shaping on the anvil the nail or the shoe.</p>
<p>But Mr. Beecher was what Mr. Spurgeon has called him, "the most
myriad-minded man since Shakespeare"; and such a mind must both
deal with many topics, and if it be true to itself, exhibit many
styles. If one were to apply to Mr. Beecher's writings the methods
which have sometimes been applied by certain Higher Critics to the
Bible, he would conclude that the man who wrote the Sermons on
Evolution and Theology could not possibly have also written the
humorous description of a house with all the modern improvements.
Sometimes grave, sometimes gay, sometimes serious, sometimes
sportive, concentrating his whole power on whatever he was doing,
working with all his might but also playing with all his might,
when he is on a literary frolic the reader would hardly suspect
that he was ever dominated by a strenuous moral purpose. Yet there
were certain common elements in Mr. Beecher's character which
appeared in his various styles, though mixed in very different
proportions and producing very different combinations. Within the
limits of such a study as this, it must suffice to indicate in very
general terms some of these elements of character which appear in
and really produce his literary method.</p>
<p>Predominant among them was a capacity to discriminate between
the essentials and the accidentals of any subject, a philosophical
perspective which enabled him to see the controlling connection and
to discard quickly such minor details as tended to obscure and to
perplex. Thus a habit was formed which led him not infrequently to
ignore necessary limitations and qualifications, and to make him
scientifically inaccurate, though vitally and ethically true. It
was this quality which led critics to say of him that he was no
theologian, though it is doubtful whether any preacher in America
since Jonathan Edwards has exerted a greater influence on its
theology. But this quality imparted clearness to his style. He
always knew what he wanted to say and said it clearly. He sometimes
produced false impressions by the very strenuousness of his aim and
the vehemence of his passion; but he was never foggy, obscure, or
ambiguous.</p>
<p>This clearness of style was facilitated by the singleness of his
purpose. He never considered what was safe, prudent, or expedient
to say, never reflected upon the effect which his speech might have
on his reputation or his influence, considered only how he could
make his hearers apprehend the truth as he saw it. He therefore
never played with words, never used them with a double meaning, or
employed them to conceal his thoughts. He was indeed utterly
incapable of making a speech unless he had a purpose to accomplish;
when he tried he invariably failed; no orator ever had less ability
to roll off airy nothings for the entertainment of an audience.</p>
<p>Coupled with this clearness of vision and singleness of purpose
was a sympathy with men singularly broad and alert. He knew the way
to men's minds, and adapted his method to the minds he wished to
reach. This quality put him at once <i>en rapport</i> with his
auditors, and with men of widely different mental constitution.
Probably no preacher has ever habitually addressed so heterogeneous
a congregation as that which he attracted to Plymouth Church. In
his famous speech at the Herbert Spencer dinner he was listened to
with equally rapt attention by the great philosopher and by the
French waiters, who stopped in their service, arrested and held by
his mingled humor, philosophy, and restrained emotion. This human
sympathy gave a peculiar dramatic quality to his imagination. He
not only recalled and reproduced material images from the past with
great vividness, he re-created in his own mind the experiences of
men whose mold was entirely different from his own. As an
illustration of this, a comparison of two sermons on Jacob before
Pharaoh, one by Dr. Talmage, the other by Mr. Beecher, is
interesting and instructive. Dr. Talmage devotes his imagination
wholly to reproducing the outward circumstances,--the court in its
splendor and the patriarch with his wagons, his household, and his
stuff; this scene Mr. Beecher etches vividly but carelessly in a
few outlines, then proceeds to delineate with care the imagined
feelings of the king, awed despite his imperial splendor by the
spiritual majesty of the peasant herdsman. Yet Mr. Beecher could
paint the outer circumstances with care when he chose to do so.
Some of his flower pictures in 'Fruits, Flowers, and Farming' will
always remain classic models of descriptive literature, the more
amazing that some of them are portraits of flowers he had never
seen when he wrote the description.</p>
<p>While his imagination illuminated nearly all he said or wrote,
it was habitually the instrument of some moral purpose; he rarely
ornamented for ornament's sake. His pictures gave beauty, but they
were employed not to give beauty but clearness. He was thus saved
from mixed metaphors, the common fault of imaginative writings
which are directed to no end, and thus are liable to become first
lawless, then false, finally self-contradictory and absurd. The
massive Norman pillars of Durham Cathedral are marred by the
attempt which some architect has made to give them grace and beauty
by adding ornamentation. Rarely if ever did Mr. Beecher fall into
the error of thus mixing in an incongruous structure two
architectural styles. He knew when to use the Norman strength and
solidity, and when the Gothic lightness and grace.</p>
<p>Probably his keen sense of humor would have preserved him from
this not uncommon error. It is said that the secret of humor is the
quick perception of incongruous relations. This would seem to have
been the secret of Mr. Beecher's humor, for he had in an eminent
degree what the phrenologists call the faculty of comparison. This
was seen in his arguments, which were more often analogical than
logical; seen not less in that his humor was not employed with
deliberate intent to relieve a too serious discourse, but was
itself the very product of his seriousness. He was humorous, but
rarely witty, as, for the same reason, he was imaginative but not
fanciful. For both his imagination and his humor were the servants
of his moral purpose; and as he did not employ the one merely as a
pleasing ornament, so he never went out of his way to introduce a
joke or a funny story to make a laugh.</p>
<p>Speaking broadly, Mr. Beecher's style as an orator passed
through three epochs. In the first, best illustrated by his
'Sermons to Young Men,' preached in Indianapolis, his imagination
is the predominant faculty. Those sermons will remain in the
history of homiletical literature as remarkable of their kind, but
not as a pulpit classic for all times; for the critic will truly
say that the imagination is too exuberant, the dramatic element
sometimes becoming melodramatic, and the style lacking in
simplicity. In the second epoch, best illustrated by the Harper and
Brothers edition of his selected sermons, preached in the earlier
and middle portion of his Brooklyn ministry, the imagination is
still pervasive, but no longer predominant. The dramatic fire still
burns, but with a steadier heat. Imagination, dramatic instinct,
personal sympathy, evangelical passion, and a growing philosophic
thought-structure, combine to make the sermons of this epoch the
best illustration of his power as a popular preacher. In each
sermon he holds up a truth like his favorite opal, turning it from
side to side and flashing its opalescent light upon his
congregation, but so as always to show the secret fire at the heart
of it. In the third epoch, best illustrated by his sermons on
Evolution and Theology, the philosophic quality of his mind
predominates; his imagination is subservient to and the instrument
of clear statement, his dramatic quality shows itself chiefly in
his realization of mental conditions foreign to his own, and his
style, though still rich in color and warm with feeling, is
mastered, trained, and directed by his intellectual purpose. In the
first epoch he is the painter, in the second the preacher, in the
third the teacher.</p>
<p>Judgments will differ: in mine the last epoch is the best, and
its utterances will long live a classic in pulpit literature. The
pictures of the first epoch are already fading; the fervid oratory
of the second epoch depends so much on the personality of the
preacher, that as the one grows dim in the distance the other must
grow dim also; but the third, more enduring though less
fascinating, will remain so long as the heart of man hungers for
the truth and the life of God,--that is, for a rational religion, a
philosophy of life which shall combine reverence and love, and a
reverence and love which shall not call for the abdication of the
reason.</p>

<center><b>BOOK-STORES AND BOOKS</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Star Papers'</center>
<br>
<p>Nothing marks the increasing wealth of our times, and the growth
of the public mind toward refinement, more than the demand for
books. Within ten years the sale of common books has increased
probably two hundred per cent., and it is daily increasing. But the
sale of expensive works, and of library editions of standard
authors in costly bindings, is yet more noticeable. Ten years ago
such a display of magnificent works as is to be found at the
Appletons' would have been a precursor of bankruptcy. There was no
demand for them. A few dozen, in one little show-case, was the
prudent whole. Now, one whole side of an immense store is not only
filled with admirably bound library books, but from some
inexhaustible source the void continually made in the shelves is at
once refilled. A reserve of heroic books supply the places of those
that fall. Alas! where is human nature so weak as in a book-store!
Speak of the appetite for drink; or of a <i>bon vivant's</i> relish
for a dinner! What are these mere animal throes and ragings
compared with those fantasies of taste, those yearnings of the
imagination, those insatiable appetites of intellect, which
bewilder a student in a great bookseller's temptation-hall?</p>
<p>How easily one may distinguish a genuine lover of books from a
worldly man! With what subdued and yet glowing enthusiasm does he
gaze upon the costly front of a thousand embattled volumes! How
gently he draws them down, as if they were little children; how
tenderly he handles them! He peers at the title-page, at the text,
or the notes, with the nicety of a bird examining a flower. He
studies the binding: the leather,--russia, English calf, morocco;
the lettering, the gilding, the edging, the hinge of the cover! He
opens it and shuts it, he holds it off and brings it nigh. It
suffuses his whole body with book magnetism. He walks up and down
in a maze at the mysterious allotments of Providence, that gives so
much money to men who spend it upon their appetites, and so little
to men who would spend it in benevolence or upon their refined
tastes! It is astonishing, too, how one's necessities multiply in
the presence of the supply. One never knows how many things it is
impossible to do without till he goes to Windle's or Smith's
house-furnishing stores. One is surprised to perceive, at some
bazaar or fancy and variety store, how many <i>conveniences</i> he
needs. He is satisfied that his life must have been utterly
inconvenient aforetime. And thus too one is inwardly convicted, at
Appletons', of having lived for years without books which he is now
satisfied that one cannot live without!</p>
<p>Then, too, the subtle process by which the man convinces himself
that he can afford to buy. No subtle manager or broker ever saw
through a maze of financial embarrassments half so quick as a poor
book-buyer sees his way clear to pay for what he <i>must</i> have.
He promises himself marvels of retrenchment; he will eat less, or
less costly viands, that he may buy more food for the mind. He will
take an extra patch, and go on with his raiment another year, and
buy books instead of coats. Yea, he will write books, that he may
buy books! The appetite is insatiable. Feeding does not satisfy it.
It rages by the fuel which is put upon it. As a hungry man eats
first and pays afterward, so the book-buyer purchases and then
works at the debt afterward. This paying is rather medicinal. It
cures for a time. But a relapse takes place. The same longing, the
same promises of self-denial. He promises himself to put spurs on
both heels of his industry; and then, besides all this, he will
<i>somehow</i> get along when the time for payment comes! Ah! this
SOMEHOW! That word is as big as a whole world, and is stuffed with
all the vagaries and fantasies that Fancy ever bred upon Hope. And
yet, is there not some comfort in buying books, <i>to be</i> paid
for? We have heard of a sot who wished his neck as long as the worm
of a still, that he might so much the longer enjoy the flavor of
the draught! Thus, it is a prolonged excitement of purchase, if you
feel for six months in a slight doubt whether the book is honestly
your own or not. Had you paid down, that would have been the end of
it. There would have been no affectionate and beseeching look of
your books at you, every time you saw them, saying, as plain as a
book's eyes can say, "Do not let me be taken from you."</p>
<p>Moreover, buying books before you can pay for them promotes
caution. You do not feel quite at liberty to take them home. You
are married. Your wife keeps an account-book. She knows to a penny
what you can and what you cannot afford. She has no "speculation"
in <i>her</i> eyes. Plain figures make desperate work with airy
"<i>somehows</i>." It is a matter of no small skill and experience
to get your books home, and into their proper places, undiscovered.
Perhaps the blundering express brings them to the door just at
evening. "What is it, my dear?" she says to you. "Oh! nothing--a
few books that I cannot do without." That smile! A true housewife
that loves her husband can smile a whole arithmetic at him at one
look! Of course she insists, in the kindest way, in sympathizing
with you in your literary acquisition. She cuts the strings of the
bundle (and of your heart), and out comes the whole story. You have
bought a complete set of costly English books, full bound in calf,
extra gilt! You are caught, and feel very much as if bound in calf
yourself, and admirably lettered.</p>
<p>Now, this must not happen frequently. The books must be smuggled
home. Let them be sent to some near place. Then, when your wife has
a headache, or is out making a call, or has lain down, run the
books across the frontier and threshold, hastily undo them, stop
only for one loving glance as you put them away in the closet, or
behind other books on the shelf, or on the topmost shelf. Clear
away the twine and wrapping-paper, and every suspicious
circumstance. Be very careful not to be too kind. That often brings
on detection. Only the other day we heard it said, somewhere, "Why,
how good you have been lately. I am really afraid that you have
been carrying on mischief secretly." Our heart smote us. It was a
fact. That very day we had bought a few books which "we could not
do without." After a while you can bring out one volume,
accidentally, and leave it on the table. "Why, my dear, <i>what</i>
a beautiful book! Where <i>did</i> you borrow it?" You glance over
the newspaper, with the quietest tone you can command:
"<i>That</i>! oh! that is <i>mine</i>. Have you not seen it before?
It has been in the house these two months." and you rush on with
anecdote and incident, and point out the binding, and that peculiar
trick of gilding, and everything else you can think of; but it all
will not do; you cannot rub out that roguish, arithmetical smile.
People may talk about the equality of the sexes! They are not
equal. The silent smile of a sensible, loving woman will vanquish
ten men. Of course you repent, and in time form a habit of
repenting.</p>
<p>Another method which will be found peculiarly effective is to
make a <i>present</i> of some fine work to your wife. Of course,
whether she or you have the name of buying it, it will go into your
collection, and be yours to all intents and purposes. But it stops
remark in the presentation. A wife could not reprove you for so
kindly thinking of her. No matter what she suspects, she will say
nothing. And then if there are three or four more works which have
come home with the gift-book--they will pass through the favor of
the other.</p>
<p>These are pleasures denied to wealth and old bachelors. Indeed,
one cannot imagine the peculiar pleasure of buying books if one is
rich and stupid. There must be some pleasure, or so many would not
do it. But the full flavor, the whole relish of delight only comes
to those who are so poor that they must engineer for every book.
They sit down before them, and besiege them. They are captured.
Each book has a secret history of ways and means. It reminds you of
subtle devices by which you insured and made it yours, in spite of
poverty!</p>

<p>A man undertakes to jump across a chasm that is ten feet wide,

<p>I have heard men, in family prayer, confess their wickedness,
and pray that God would forgive them the sins that they got from
Adam; but I do not know that I ever heard a father in family prayer
confess that he had a bad temper. I never heard a mother confess in
family prayer that she was irritable and snappish. I never heard
persons bewail those sins which are the engineers and artificers of
the moral condition of the family. The angels would not know what
to do with a prayer that began, "Lord, thou knowest that I am a
scold."--SERMON: 'Peaceableness.'</p>
<p>Getting up early is venerable. Since there has been a literature
or a history, the habit of early rising has been recommended for
health, for pleasure, and for business. The ancients are held up to
us for examples. But they lived so far to the east, and so near the
sun, that it was much easier for them than for us. People in Europe
always get up several hours before we do; people in Asia several
hours before Europeans do; and we suppose, as men go toward the
sun, it gets easier and easier, until, somewhere in the Orient,
probably they step out of bed involuntarily, or, like a flower
blossoming, they find their bed-clothes gently opening and turning
back, by the mere attraction of light.--'EYES AND EARS.'</p>
<p>There are some men who never wake up enough to swear a good

<br>
<center><b>POVERTY AND THE GOSPEL</b></center>
<br>
<center>TEXTS: Luke iv. 17-21, Matt. xi. 2-6</center>
<br>
<p>Here was Christ's profession of his faith; here is the history
also of his examination, to see whether he were fit to preach or
not. It is remarkable that in both these instances the most
significant indication that he had, both of his descent from God
and of his being worthy of the Messiahship, consisted in this
simple exposition of the line of his preaching,--that he took sides
with the poor, neglected, and lost. He emphasized this, that his
gospel was a gospel of mercy to the poor; and that word "poor," in
its most comprehensive sense, looked at historically, includes in
it everything that belongs to human misery, whether it be by reason
of sin or depravity, or by oppression, or by any other cause. This,
then, is the disclosure by Christ himself of the genius of
Christianity. It is his declaration of what the gospel meant.</p>
<p>It is still further interpreted when you follow the life of
Christ, and see how exactly in his conduct he interpreted, or
rather fortified, the words of the declaration. His earliest life
was that of labor and poverty, and it was labor and poverty in the
poorest districts of Palestine. The dignified, educated, and
aristocratic part of the nation dwelt in Judea, and the Athens of
Palestine was Jerusalem. There Christ spent the least part of his
life, and that in perpetual discussions. But in Galilee the most of
his miracles, certainly the earlier, were performed, and the most
of his discourses that are contained bodily in the gospels were
uttered. He himself carried out the declaration that the gospel was
for the poor. The very miracles that Christ performed were not
philosophical enigmas, as we look at them. They were all of them
miracles of mercy. They were miracles to those who were suffering
helplessly where natural law and artificial means could not reach
them. In every case the miracles of Christ were mercies, though we
look at them in a spirit totally different from that in which he
performed them.</p>
<p>In doing thus, Christ represented the best spirit of the Old
Testament. The Jewish Scriptures teach mercy, the very genius of
Jewish institutions was that of mercy, and especially to the poor,
the weak, the helpless. The crimes against which the prophets
thundered their severest denunciations were crimes upon the
helpless. It was the avarice of the rich, it was the unbounded lust
and cruelty of the strong, that were denounced by them. They did
not preach against human nature in general. They did not preach
against total depravity and the original condition of mankind. They
singled out violations of the law in the magistrate, in the king,
in rich men, everywhere, and especially all those wrongs committed
by power either unconsciously or with purpose, cruelty upon the
helpless, the defenseless, the poor and the needy. When Christ
declared that this was his ministry, he took his text from the Old
Testament; he spoke in its spirit. It was to preach the gospel to
the poor that he was sent. He had come into the world to change the
condition of mankind. Beginning at the top? No; beginning at the
bottom and working up to the top from the bottom.</p>
<p>When this view of the gospel enters into our understanding and
is fully comprehended by us, how exactly it fits in with the order
of nature, and with the order of the unfolding of human life and
human society! It takes sides with the poor; and so the universal
tendency of Providence and of history, slowly unfolded, is on the
whole going from low to high, from worse to better, and from good
toward the perfect. When we consider, we see that man begins as a
helpless thing, a baby zero without a figure before it; and every
step in life adds a figure to it and gives it more and more worth.
On the whole, the law of unfolding throughout the world is from
lower to higher; and though when applied to the population of the
globe it is almost inconceivable, still, with many back-sets and
reactions, the tendency of the universe is thus from lower to
higher. Why? Let any man consider whether there is not of necessity
a benevolent intelligence somewhere that is drawing up from the
crude toward the ripe, from the rough toward the smooth, from bad
to good, and from good through better toward best. The tendency
upward runs like a golden thread through the history of the whole
world, both in the unfolding of human life and in the unfolding of
the race itself. Thus the tendency of nature is in accordance with
the tendency of the gospel as declared by Jesus Christ, namely,
that it is a ministry of mercy to the needy.</p>
<p>The vast majority of mankind have been and yet are poor. There
are ten thousand men poor where there is one man even comfortably
provided for, body and soul, and hundreds of thousands where there
is one rich, taking the whole world together. The causes of poverty
are worthy a moment's consideration. Climate and soil have much to
do with it. Men whose winter lasts nine or ten months in the year,
and who have a summer of but one or two months, as in the extreme
north,--how could they amass property, how could they enlarge their
conditions of peace and of comfort? There are many parts of the
earth where men live on the borders of deserts, or in mountain
fastnesses, or in arctic rigors, where anything but poverty is
impossible, and where it requires the whole thought, genius,
industry, and foresight of men, the year round, just to feed
themselves and to live. Bad government, where men are insecure in
their property, has always been a very fertile source of poverty.
The great valley of Esdraelon in Northern Palestine is one of the
most fertile in the world, and yet famine perpetually stalks on the
heels of the population; for if you sow and the harvest waves,
forth come hordes of Bedouins to reap your harvest for you, and
leave you, after all your labor, to poverty and starvation. When a
man has lost his harvest in that way two or three times, and is
deprived of the reward of his labors, he never emerges from
poverty, but sinks into indolence; and that, by and by, breeds
apathetic misery. So where the government over-taxes its subjects,
as is the case in the Orient with perhaps nearly all of the
populations there to-day, it cuts the sinews and destroys all the
motives of industry; and without industry there can be neither
virtue, morality, nor religion in any long period. Wars breaking
out, from whatever cause, tend to absorb property, or to destroy
property, or to prevent the development of property. Yet, strange
as it may seem, the men who suffer from war are those whose
passions generally lead it on. The king may apply the spark, but
the combustion is with the common people. They furnish the army,
they themselves become destroyers; and the ravages of war, in the
history of the human family, have destroyed more property than it
is possible to enter into the thoughts of men to conceive.</p>
<p>But besides these external reasons of poverty, there are certain
great primary and fundamental reasons. Ignorance breeds poverty.
What is property? It is the product of intelligence, of skill, of
thought applied to material substances. All property is raw
material that has been shaped to uses by intelligent skill. Where
intelligence is low, the power of producing property is low. It is
the husbandman who thinks, foresees, plans, and calls on all
natural laws to serve him, whose farm brings forth forty, fifty,
and a hundred fold. The ignorant peasant grubs and groans, and
reaps but one handful where he has sown two. It is knowledge that
is the gold mine; for although every knowing man may not be able to
be a rich man, yet out of ignorance riches do not spring anywhere.
Ignorant men may be made the factors of wealth when they are guided
and governed by superior intelligence. Slave labor produced
gigantic plantations and estates. The slave was always poor, but
his master was rich, because the master had the intelligence and
the knowledge, and the slave gave the work. All through human
society, men who represent simple ignorance will be tools, and the
men who represent intelligence will be the master mechanics, the
capitalists. All society to-day is agitated with this question of
justice as between the laborer and the thinker. Now, it is no use
to kick against the pricks. A man who can only work and not think
is not the equal in any regard of the man who can think, who can
plan, who can combine, and who can live not for to-day alone, but
for to-morrow, for next month, for the next year, for ten years.
This is the man whose volume will just as surely weigh down that of
the unthinking man as a ton will weigh down a pound in the scale.
Avoirdupois is moral, industrial, as well as material, in this
respect; and the primary, most usual cause of unprosperity in
industrial callings therefore lies in the want of
intelligence,--either in the slender endowment of the man, or more
likely the want of education in his ordinary and average endowment.
Any class of men who live for to-day, and do not care whether they
know anything more than they did yesterday or last year--those men
may have a temporary and transient prosperity, but they are the
children of poverty just as surely as the decrees of God stand.
Ignorance enslaves men among men; knowledge is the creator of
liberty and wealth.</p>
<p>As with undeveloped intelligence, so the appetites of men and
their passions are causes of poverty. Men who live from the basilar
faculties will invariably live in inferior stations. The men who
represent animalism are as a general fact at the bottom. They may
say it is government, climate, soil, want of capital, they may say
what they please, but it is the devil of laziness that is in them,
or of passion, that comes out in eating, in gluttony, in drinking
and drunkenness, in wastefulness on every side. I do not say that
the laboring classes in modern society are poor because they are
self-indulgent, but I say that it unquestionably would be wise for
all men who feel irritated that they are so unprosperous, if they
would take heed to the moral condition in which they are living, to
self-denial in their passions and appetites, and to increasing the
amount of their knowledge and fidelity. Although moral conditions
are not the sole causes, they are principal causes, of the poverty
of the working classes throughout the world. It is their misfortune
as well as their fault; but it is the reason why they do not rise.
Weakness does not rise; strength does.</p>
<p>All these causes indicate that the poor need moral and
intellectual culture. "I was sent to preach the gospel to the
poor:" not to distribute provisions, not to relieve their wants;
that will be included, but that was not Christ's primary idea. It
was not to bring in a golden period of fruitfulness when men would
not be required to work. It was not that men should lie down on
their backs under the trees, and that the boughs should bend over
and drop the ripe fruit into their mouths. No such conception of
equality and abundance entered into the mind of the Creator or of
Him who represented the Creator. To preach the gospel to the poor
was to awaken the mind of the poor. It was to teach the poor--"Take
up your cross, deny yourselves, and follow me. Restrain all those
sinful appetites and passions, and hold them back by the power of
knowledge and by the power of conscience; grow, because you are the
sons of God, into the likeness of your Father." So he preached to
the poor. That was preaching prosperity to them. That was teaching
them how to develop their outward condition by developing their
inward forces. To develop that in men which should make them wiser,
purer, and stronger, is the aim of the gospel. Men have supposed
that the whole end of the gospel was reconciliation between God and
men who had fallen--though they were born sinners in their fathers
and grandfathers and ancestors; to reconcile them with God--as if
an abstract disagreement had been the cause of all this world's
trouble! But the plain facts of history are simply that men, if
they have not come from animals, have yet dwelt in animalism, and
that that which should raise them out of it was some such moral
influence as should give them the power of ascension into
intelligence, into virtue, and into true godliness. That is what
the gospel was sent for; good news, a new power that is kindled
under men, that will lift them from their low ignorances and
degradations and passions, and lift them into a higher realm; a
power that will take away all the poverty that needs to be taken
away. Men may be doctrinally depraved; they are much more depraved
practically. Men may need to be brought into the knowledge of God
speculatively; but what they do need is to be brought into the
knowledge of themselves practically. I do not say that the gospel
has nothing in it of this kind of spiritual knowledge; it is full
of it, but its aim and the reason why it should be preached is to
wake up in men the capacity for good things, industries,
frugalities, purities, moralities, kindnesses one toward another:
and when men are brought into that state they are reconciled. When
men are reconciled with the law of creation and the law of their
being, they are reconciled with God. Whenever a man is reconciled
with the law of knowledge, he is reconciled with the God of
knowledge, so far. Whenever a man is reconciled with the law of
purity he is so far reconciled with a God of purity. When men have
lifted themselves to that point that they recognize that they are
the children of God, the kingdom of God has begun within them.</p>
<p>Although the spirit and practice of the gospel will develop
charities, will develop physical comfort, will feed men, will heal
men, will provide for their physical needs, yet the primary and
fundamental result of the gospel is to develop man himself, not
merely to relieve his want on an occasion. It does that as a matter
of course, but that is scarcely the first letter of the alphabet.
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all
these things [food and raiment] shall be added unto you." The way
to relieve a man is to develop him so that he will need no relief,
or to raise higher and higher the character of the help that he
demands.</p>
<p>In testing Christianity, then, I remark first that it is to be
tested not by creeds, but by conduct. The evidence of the gospel,
the reality of the gospel that is preached in schools or churches,
is to be found in the spirit that is developed by it, not in the
technical creeds that men have constructed out of it. The biography
of men who have died might be hung up in their sepulchres; but you
could not tell what kind of a man this one had been, just by
reading his life there--while he lay dead in dust before you. There
are thousands of churches that have a creed of Christianity hung up
in them, but the church itself is a sepulchre full of dead men's
bones; and indeed, many churches in modern times are gnawing the
bones of their ancestors, and doing almost nothing else.</p>
<p>The gospel, changed from a spirit of humanity into a
philosophical system of doctrine, is perverted. It is not the
gospel. The great heresy in the world of religion is a cold heart,
not a luminous head. It is not that intelligence is of no use in
religion. By no means. Neither would we wage a crusade against
philosophical systems of moral truth. But where the active sympathy
and humanity of loving hearts for living men, and for men in the
ratio in which they are low, is laid aside or diminished to a
minimum, and in its place is a well-elaborated philosophical system
of moral truths, hewn and jointed,--the gospel is gone. If you go
along the sea-shores, you will often find the shells of fish--the
fish dead and gone, the shells left. And if you go along the shores
of ecclesiastical organization, you will find multitudes of shells
of the gospel, out of which the living substance has gone long ago.
Organized Christianity--that is, the institutions of Christianity
have been in the first instance its power, and in the second
instance its damnation. The moment you substitute the machinery of
education for education itself, the moment you build schools and do
not educate, build colleges that do not increase knowledge in the
pupils, you have sacrificed the aim for the instrument by which you
were to gain that aim. In churches, the moment it is more important
to maintain buildings, rituals, ministers, chanters, and all the
paraphernalia of moral education than the spirit of personal
sympathy, the moment these are more sacred to men than is the
welfare of the population round about which they were set to take
care of, that very moment Christ is dead in that place; that very
moment religion in the midst of all its institutions has perished.
I am bound to say that in the history of the world, while religious
institutions have been valuable and have done a great deal of good,
they have perhaps done as much harm as good. There is scarcely one
single perversion of civil government, there is scarcely one single
persecution of men, there is scarcely a single one of the great
wars that have depopulated the globe, there is scarcely one great
heresy developed out of the tyranny of the church, that has not
been the fruit of institutional religion; while that spirit of
humanity which was to give the institution its motive power has to
a certain extent died out of it.</p>
<p>Secondly, churches organized upon elective affinities of men are
contrary to the spirit of the gospel. We may associate with men who
are of like taste with ours. We have that privilege. If men are
knowledgeable and intellectual, there is no sin in their choosing
for intimate companions and associates men of like pursuits and
like intellectual qualities. That is right. If men are rich, there
is no reason why men who hold like property should not confer with
each other, and form interests and friendships together. If men are
refined, if they have become &aelig;sthetic, there is no reason why
they should not associate in the realm of beauty, artists with
artists, nor why the great enjoyers of beauty should not be in
sympathy. Exit all these are not to be allowed to do it at the
price of abandoning common humanity; you have no right to make your
nest in the boughs of knowledge, and let all the rest of the world
go as it will. You have no right to make your home among those who
are polished and exquisite and fastidious in their tastes, whose
garments are beauty, whose house is a temple of art, and all whose
associations are of like kind, and neglect common humanity. You
have no right to shut yourself up in a limited company of those who
are like you in these directions, and let all the rest of men go
without sympathy and without care. It is a right thing for a man to
salute his neighbor who salutes him; but if you salute those who
salute you, says Christ, what thank have ye--do not even the
publicans so? It is no sin that a man, being intellectual in his
nature, should like intellectual people, and gratify that which is
divine and God-like in him; but if, because he likes intellectual
people, he loses all interest in ignorant people, it convicts him
of depravity and of moral perversion. When this is carried out to
such an extent that churches are organized upon sharp
classification, upon elective affinities, they not only cease to be
Christian churches, but they are heretical; not perhaps in
doctrine, but worse than that, heretical in heart.</p>
<p>The fact is that a church needs poor men and wicked men as much
as it does pure men and virtuous men and pious men. What man needs
is familiarity with universal human nature. He needs never to
separate himself from men in daily life. It is not necessary that
in our houses we should bring pestilential diseases or pestilential
examples, but somehow we must hold on to men if they are wicked;
somehow the circulation between the top and the bottom must be
carried on; somehow there must be an atoning power in the heart of
every true believer of the Lord Jesus Christ who shall say, looking
out and seeing that the world is lost, and is living in sin and
misery, "I belong to it, and it belongs to me." When you take the
loaf of society and cut off the upper crust, slicing it
horizontally, you get an elect church. Yes, it is the peculiarly
elect church of selfishness. But you should cut the loaf of society
from the top down to the bottom, and take in something of
everything. True, every church would be very much edified and
advantaged if it had in it scholarly men, knowledgeable men; but
the church is strong in proportion as it has in it something of
everything, from the very top to the very bottom.</p>
<p>Now, I do not disown creeds--provided they are my own! Well, you
smile; but that is the way it has been since the world began. No
denomination believes in any creed except its own. I do not say
that men's knowledge on moral subjects may not be formulated. I
criticize the formulation of beliefs from time to time, in this:
that they are very partial; that they are formed upon the knowledge
of a past age, and that that knowledge perishes while higher and
nobler knowledge comes in; that there ought to be higher and better
forms; and that while their power is relatively small, the power of
the spirit of humanity is relatively great. When I examine a
church, I do not so much care whether its worship is to the one God
or to the triune God. I do not chiefly care for the catechism, nor
for the confession of faith, although they are both interesting. I
do not even look to see whether it is a synagogue or a Christian
church--I do not care whether it has a cross over the top of it or
is Quaker plain. I do not care whether it is Protestant, Catholic,
or anything else. Let me read the living--- the living book! What
is the spirit of the people? How do they feel among each other? How
do they feel toward the community? What is their life and conduct
in regard to the great prime moral duty of man, "Love the Lord thy
God and thy neighbor as thyself," whether he be obscure or whether
he be smiling in the very plenitude of wealth and refinement? Have
you a heart for humanity? Have you a soul that goes out for men?
Are you Christ-like? Will you spend yourself for the sake of
elevating men who need to be lifted up? That is orthodox. I do not
care what the creed is. If a church has a good creed, that is all
the more felicitous; and if it has a bad creed, a good life cures
the bad creed.</p>
<p>One of the dangers of our civilization may be seen in the light
of these considerations. We are developing so much strength founded
on popular intelligence, and this intelligence and the incitements
to it are developing such large property interests, that if the
principle of elective affinity shall sort men out and classify
them, we are steering to the not very remote danger of the
disintegration of human society. I can tell you that the classes of
men who by their knowledge, refinement, and wealth think they are
justified in separating themselves, and in making a great void
between them and the myriads of men below them, are courting their
own destruction. I look with very great interest on the process of
change going on in Great Britain, where the top of society had all
the "blood," but the circulation is growing larger and larger, and
a change is gradually taking place in their institutions. The old
nobility of Great Britain is the lordliest of aristocracies
existing in the world. Happily, on the whole, a very noble class of
men occupy the high positions: but the spirit of suffrage, this
angel of God that so many hate, is coming in on them; and when
every man in Great Britain can vote, no matter whether he is poor
or rich, whether he has knowledge or no knowledge, there must be a
very great change. Before the great day of the Lord shall come, the
valleys are to go up and the mountains are to come down; and the
mountains have started already in Great Britain and must come down.
There may be an aristocracy in any nation,--that is to say, there
may be "best men"; there ought to be an aristocracy in every
community,--that is, an aristocracy of men who speak the truth, who
are just, who are intelligent: but that aristocracy will be like a
wave of the sea; it has to be reconstituted in every generation,
and the men who are the best in the State become the aristocracy of
that State. But where rank is hereditary, if political suffrage
becomes free and universal, aristocracy cannot live. The spirit of
the gospel is democratic. The tendency of the gospel is leveling;
leveling up, not down. It is carrying the poor and the multitude
onward and upward.</p>
<p>It is said that democracies have no great men, no heroic men.
Why is it so? When you raise the average of intelligence and power
in the community it is very hard to be a great man. That is to say,
when the great mass of citizens are only ankle-high, when among the
Lilliputians a Brobdingnagian walks, he is a great man. But when
the Lilliputians grow until they get up to his shoulder, he is not
so great a man as he was by the whole length of his body. So, make
the common people grow, and there is nobody tall enough to be much
higher.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>The remarkable people of this world are useful in their way; but
the common people, after all, represent the nation, the age, and
the civilization. Go into any town or city: do not ask who lives in
that splendid house; do not say, This is a fine town, here are
streets of houses with gardens and yards, and everything that is
beautiful the whole way through. Go into the lanes, go into the
back streets, go where the mechanic lives; go where the day-laborer
lives. See what is the condition of the streets there. See what
they do with the poor, with the helpless, and the mean. If the top
of society bends perpetually over the bottom with tenderness, if
the rich and strong are the best friends of the poor and needy,
that is a civilized and a Christian community; but if the rich and
the wise are the cream and the great bulk of the population
skim-milk, that is not a prosperous community.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of irreligion in men, there is a great
deal of wickedness and depravity in men, but there are times when
it is true that the church is more dissipated than the dissipated
classes of the community. If there is one thing that stood out more
strongly than any other in the ministry of our Lord, it is the
severity with which he treated the exclusiveness of men with
knowledge, position, and a certain sort of religion, a religion of
particularity and carefulness; if there is one class of the
community against which he hurled his thunderbolts without mercy
and predicted woes, it was the scribes, Pharisees, scholars, and
priests of the temples. He told them in so many words, "The
publican and the harlot will enter the kingdom of God before you."
The worst dissipation in this world is the dry-rot of morality, and
of the so-called piety that separates men of prosperity and of
power from the poor and ignoble. They are our wards....</p>
<p>I am not a socialist. I do not preach riot. I do not preach the
destruction of property. I regard property as one of the sacred
things. The real property established by a man's own intelligence
and labor is the crystallized man himself. It is the fruit of what
his life-work has done; and not in vain, society makes crime
against it amongst the most punishable. But nevertheless, I warn
these men in a country like ours, where every man votes, whether he
came from Hungary, or from Russia, or from Germany, or from France
or Italy, or Spain or Portugal, or from the Orient,--from Japan and
China, because they too are going to vote! On the Niagara River,
logs come floating down and strike an island, and there they lodge
and accumulate for a little while, and won't go over. But the rains
come, the snows melt, the river rises, and the logs are lifted up
and down, and they go swinging over the falls. The stream of
suffrage of free men, having all the privileges of the State, is
this great stream. The figure is defective in this, that the log
goes over the Niagara Falls, but that is not the way the country is
going or will go.... There is a certain river of political life,
and everything has to go into it first or last; and if, in days to
come, a man separates himself from his fellows without sympathy, if
his wealth and power make poverty feel itself more poor and men's
misery more miserable, and set against him the whole stream of
popular feeling, that man is in danger. He may not know who
dynamites him, but there is danger; and let him take heed who is in
peril. There is nothing easier in the world than for rich men to
ingratiate themselves with the whole community in which they live,
and so secure themselves. It is not selfishness that will do it; it
is not by increasing the load of misfortune, it is not by wasting
substance in riotous living upon appetites and passions. It is by
recognizing that every man is a brother. It is by recognizing the
essential spirit of the gospel, "Love thy neighbor as thyself." It
is by using some of their vast power and riches so as to diffuse
joy in every section of the community.</p>
<p>Here then I close this discourse. How much it enrolls! How very
simple it is! It is the whole gospel. When you make an application
of it to all the phases of organization and classification of human
interests and developments, it seems as though it were as big as
the universe. Yet when you condense it, it all comes back to the
one simple creed: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and thy neighbor as thyself." Who is my neighbor? A certain
man went down to Jericho, and so on. That tells you who your
neighbor is. Whosoever has been attacked by robbers, has been
beaten, has been thrown down--by liquor, by gambling, or by any
form of wickedness; whosoever has been cast into distress, and you
are called on to raise him up--that is your neighbor. Love your
neighbor as yourself. That is the gospel.</p>

<center><b>A NEW ENGLAND SUNDAY</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Norwood'</center>
<br>
<p>It is worth all the inconveniences arising from the occasional
over-action of New England Sabbath observance, to obtain the full
flavor of a New England Sunday. But for this, one should have been
born there; should have found Sunday already waiting for him, and
accepted it with implicit and absolute conviction, as if it were a
law of nature, in the same way that night and day, summer and
winter, are parts of nature. He should have been brought up by
parents who had done the same thing, as <i>they</i> were by parents
even more strict, if that were possible; until not religious
persons peculiarly, but everybody--not churches alone, but society
itself, and all its population, those who broke it as much as those
who kept it--were stained through with the color of Sunday. Nay,
until Nature had adopted it, and laid its commands on all birds and
beasts, on the sun and winds, and upon the whole atmosphere; so
that without much imagination one might imagine, in a genuine New
England Sunday of the Connecticut River Valley stamp, that God was
still on that day resting from all the work which he had created
and made, and that all his work rested with him!</p>
<p>Over all the town rested the Lord's peace! The saw was ripping
away yesterday in the carpenter's shop, and the hammer was noisy
enough. Today there is not a sign of life there. The anvil makes no
music to-day. Tommy Taft's buckets and barrels give forth no
hollow, thumping sound. The mill is silent--only the brook
continues noisy. Listen! In yonder pine woods what a cawing of
crows! Like an echo, in a wood still more remote other crows are
answering. But even a crow's throat to-day is musical. Do they
think, because they have black coats on, that they are parsons, and
have a right to play pulpit with all the pine-trees? Nay. The birds
will not have any such monopoly,--they are all singing, and singing
all together, and no one cares whether his song rushes across
another's or not. Larks and robins, blackbirds and orioles,
sparrows and bluebirds, mocking cat-birds and wrens, were furrowing
the air with such mixtures as no other day but Sunday, when all
artificial and human sounds cease, could ever hear. Every now and
then a bobolink seemed impressed with the duty of bringing these
jangling birds into more regularity; and like a country
singing-master, he flew down the ranks, singing all the parts
himself in snatches, as if to stimulate and help the laggards. In
vain! Sunday is the birds' day, and they will have their own
democratic worship.</p>
<p>There was no sound in the village street. Look either way--not a
vehicle, not a human being. The smoke rose up soberly and quietly,
as if it said--It is Sunday! The leaves on the great elms hung
motionless, glittering in dew, as if they too, like the people who
dwelt under their shadow, were waiting for the bell to ring for
meeting. Bees sung and flew as usual; but honey-bees have a Sunday
way with them all the week, and could scarcely change for the
better on the seventh day.</p>
<p>But oh, the Sun! It had sent before and cleared every stain out
of the sky. The blue heaven was not dim and low, as on secular
days, but curved and deep, as if on Sunday it shook off all
incumbrance which during the week had lowered and flattened it, and
sprang back to the arch and symmetry of a dome. All ordinary sounds
caught the spirit of the day. The shutting of a door sounded twice
as far as usual. The rattle of a bucket in a neighbor's yard, no
longer mixed with heterogeneous noises, seemed a new sound. The
hens went silently about, and roosters crowed in psalm-tunes. And
when the first bell rung, Nature seemed overjoyed to find something
that it might do without breaking Sunday, and rolled the sound over
and over, and pushed it through the air, and raced with it over
field and hill, twice as far as on week-days. There were no less
than seven steeples in sight from the belfry, and the sexton
said:--"On still Sundays I've heard the bell, at one time and
another, when the day was fair, and the air moving in the right
way, from every one of them steeples, and I guess likely they've
all heard our'n."</p>
<p>"Come, Rose!" said Agate Bissell, at an even earlier hour than
when Rose usually awakened--"Come, Rose, it is the Sabbath. We must
not be late Sunday morning, of all days in the week. It is the
Lord's day."</p>
<p>There was little preparation required for the day. Saturday
night, in some parts of New England, was considered almost as
sacred as Sunday itself. After sundown on Saturday night no play,
and no work except such as is immediately preparatory to the
Sabbath, were deemed becoming in good Christians. The clothes had
been laid out the night before. Nothing was forgotten. The best
frock was ready; the hose and shoes were waiting. Every article of
linen, every ruffle and ribbon, were selected on Saturday night.
Every one in the house walked mildly. Every one spoke in a low
tone. Yet all were cheerful. The mother had on her kindest face,
and nobody laughed, but everybody made it up in smiling. The nurse
smiled, and the children held on to keep down a giggle within the
lawful bounds of a smile; and the doctor looked rounder and calmer
than ever; and the dog flapped his tail on the floor with a
softened sound, as if he had fresh wrapped it in hair for that very
day. Aunt Toodie, the cook (so the children had changed Mrs. Sarah
Good's name), was blacker than ever and shinier than ever, and the
coffee better, and the cream richer, and the broiled chickens
juicier and more tender, and the biscuit whiter, and the corn-bread
more brittle and sweet.</p>
<p>When the good doctor read the Scriptures at family prayer, the
infection of silence had subdued everything except the clock. Out
of the wide hall could be heard in the stillness the old clock,
that now lifted up its voice with unwonted emphasis, as if,
unnoticed through the bustling week, Sunday was its vantage ground,
to proclaim to mortals the swift flight of time. And if the old
pedant performed the task with something of an ostentatious
precision, it was because in that house nothing else put on
official airs, and the clock felt the responsibility of doing it
for the whole mansion.</p>
<p>And now came mother and catechism; for Mrs. Wentworth followed
the old custom, and declared that no child of hers should grow up
without catechism. Secretly, the doctor was quite willing, though
openly he played off upon the practice a world of good-natured
discouragement, and declared that there should be an opposition set
up--a catechism of Nature, with natural laws for decrees, and
seasons for Providence, and flowers for graces! The younger
children were taught in simple catechism. But Rose, having reached
the mature age of twelve, was now manifesting her power over the
Westminster Shorter Catechism; and as it was simply an achievement
of memory and not of the understanding, she had the book at great
advantage, and soon subdued every question and answer in it. As
much as possible, the doctor was kept aloof on such occasions. His
grave questions were not to edification, and often they caused Rose
to stumble, and brought down sorely the exultation with which she
rolled forth, "They that are effectually called do in this life
partake of justification, adoption, sanctification, and the several
benefits which in this life do either accompany or flow from
them."</p>
<p>"What do those words mean, Rose?"</p>
<p>"Which words, pa?"</p>
<p>"Adoption, sanctification, and justification?"</p>
<p>Rose hesitated, and looked at her mother for rescue.</p>
<p>"Doctor, why do you trouble the child? Of course she don't know
yet all the meaning. But that will come to her when she grows
older."</p>
<p>"You make a nest of her memory, then, and put words there, like
eggs, for future hatching?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is it exactly: birds do not hatch their eggs the
minute they lay them. They wait."</p>
<p>"Laying eggs at twelve to be hatched at twenty is subjecting
them to some risk, is it not?"</p>
<p>"It might be so with eggs, but not with the catechism. That will
keep without spoiling a hundred years!"</p>
<p>"Because it is so dry?"</p>
<p>"Because it is so good. But do, dear husband, go away, and not
put notions in the children's heads. It's hard enough already to
get them through their tasks. Here's poor Arthur, who has been two
Sundays on one question, and has not got it yet."</p>
<p>Arthur, aforesaid, was sharp and bright in anything addressed to
his reason, but he had no verbal memory, and he was therefore
wading painfully through the catechism like a man in a deep-muddy
road; with this difference, that the man carries too much clay with
him, while nothing stuck to poor Arthur.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>The beauty of the day, the genial season of the year, brought
forth every one; old men and their feebler old wives, young and
hearty men and their plump and ruddy companions,--young men and
girls and children, thick as punctuation points in Hebrew text,
filled the street. In a low voice, they spoke to each other in
single sentences.</p>
<p>"A fine day! There'll be a good congregation out to-day."</p>
<p>"Yes; we may expect a house full. How is Widow Cheney--have you
heard?"</p>
<p>"Well, not much better; can't hold out many days. It will be a
great loss to the children."</p>
<p>"Yes; but we must all die--nobody can skip his turn. Does she
still talk about them that's gone?"</p>
<p>"They say not. I believe she's sunk into a quiet way; and it
looks as if she'd go off easy."</p>
<p>"Sunday is a good day for dying--it's about the only journey
that speeds well on this day!"</p>
<p>There was something striking in the outflow of people into the
street, that till now had seemed utterly deserted. There was no
fevered hurry; no negligent or poorly dressed people. Every family
came in groups--old folks and young children; and every member
blossomed forth in his best apparel, like a rose-bush in June. Do
you know that man in a silk hat and new black coat? Probably it is
some stranger. No; it is the carpenter, Mr. Baggs, who was racing
about yesterday with his sleeves rolled up, and a dust-and-business
look in his face! I knew you would not know him. Adams Gardner, the
blacksmith,--does he not look every inch a judge, now that he is
clean-washed, shaved, and dressed? His eyes are as bright as the
sparks that fly from his anvil!</p>
<p>Are not the folks proud of their children? See what groups of
them! How ruddy and plump are most! Some are roguish, and cut
clandestine capers at every chance. Others seem like wax figures,
so perfectly proper are they. Little hands go slyly through the
pickets to pluck a tempting flower. Other hands carry hymn-books or
Bibles. But, carry what they may, dressed as each parent can
afford, is there anything the sun shines upon more beautiful than
these troops of Sunday children?</p>
<p>The old bell had it all its own way up in the steeple. It was
the licensed noise of the day. In a long shed behind the church
stood a score and half-score of wagons and chaises and
carryalls,--the horses already beginning the forenoon's work of
stamping and whisking the flies. More were coming. Hiram Beers had
"hitched up," and brought two loads with his new hack; and now,
having secured the team, he stood with a few admiring young fellows
about him, remarking on the people as they came up.</p>
<p>"There's Trowbridge--he'll git asleep afore the first prayer's
over. I don't b'lieve he's heerd a sermon in ten years. I've seen
him sleep standin' up in singin'.</p>
<p>"Here comes Deacon Marble,--smart old feller, ain't
he?--wouldn't think it, jest to look at him! Face looks like an ear
of last summer's sweet corn, all dried up; but I tell ye he's got
the juice in him yit! Aunt Polly's gittin' old, ain't she? They say
she can't walk half the time--lost the use of her limbs; but it's
all gone to her tongue. That's as good as a razor, and a sight
better 'n mine, for it never needs sharpenin'.</p>
<p>"Stand away, boys, there's 'Biah Cathcart. Good horses--not
fast, but mighty strong, just like the owner."</p>
<p>And with that Hiram touched his new Sunday hat to Mrs. Cathcart
and Alice; and as he took the horses by the bits, he dropped his
head and gave the Cathcart boys a look of such awful solemnity, all
except one eye, that they lost their sobriety. Barton alone
remained sober as a judge.</p>
<p>"Here comes 'Dot-and-Go-One' and his wife. They're my kind o'
Christians. She is a saint, at any rate."</p>
<p>"How is it with you, Tommy Taft?"</p>
<p>"Fair to middlin', thank'e. Such weather would make a hand-spike
blossom, Hiram."</p>
<p>"Don't you think that's a leetle strong, Tommy, for Sunday?
P'raps you mean afore it's cut?"</p>
<p>"Sartin; that's what I mean. But you mustn't stop me, Hiram.
Parson Buell 'll be lookin' for me. He never begins till I git
there."</p>
<p>"You mean you always git there 'fore he begins."</p>
<p>Next, Hiram's prying eyes saw Mr. Turfmould, the sexton and
undertaker, who seemed to be in a pensive meditation upon all the
dead that he had ever buried. He looked upon men in a mild and
pitying manner, as if he forgave them for being in good health. You
could not help feeling that he gazed upon you with a professional
eye, and saw just how you would look in the condition which was to
him the most interesting period of a man's earthly state. He walked
with a soft tread, as if he was always at a funeral; and when he
shook your hand, his left hand half followed his right, as if he
were about beginning to lay you out. He was one of the few men
absorbed by his business, and who unconsciously measured all things
from its standpoint.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Turfmould! How's your health? How is business
with you?"</p>
<p>"Good--the Lord be praised! I've no reason to complain."</p>
<p>And he glided silently and smoothly into the church.</p>
<p>"There comes Judge Bacon, white and ugly," said the critical
Hiram. "I wonder what he comes to meetin' for. Lord knows he needs
it, sly, slippery old sinner! Face's as white as a lily; his
heart's as black as a chimney flue afore it's cleaned. He'll get
his flue burned out if he don't repent, that's certain. He don't
believe the Bible. They say he don't believe in God. Wal, I guess
it's pretty even between 'em. Shouldn't wonder if God didn't
believe in him neither."</p>
<p>As soon as the afternoon service was over, every horse on the
green knew that it was time for him to go home. Some grew restless
and whinnied for their masters. Nimble hands soon put them into the
shafts or repaired any irregularity of harness. Then came such a
scramble of vehicles to the church door for the older persons;
while young women and children, venturing further out upon the
green, were taken up hastily, that the impatient horses might as
soon as possible turn their heads homeward. Clouds of dust began to
arise along every outward-going road. In less than ten minutes not
a wagon or chaise was seen upon the village green. They were
whirling homeward at the very best pace that the horses could
raise. Stiff old steeds vainly essayed a nimbler gait, but gave it
up in a few rods, and fell back to the steady jog. Young horses,
tired of long standing, and with a strong yearning for evening
oats, shot along the level ground, rushed up the little hills, or
down upon the other side, in the most un-Sunday-like haste. The
scene was not altogether unlike the return from a military funeral,
<i>to</i> which men march with sad music and slow, but <i>from</i>
which they return nimbly marching to the most brilliant
quick-step.</p>
<p>In half an hour Norwood was quiet again. The dinner, on Sunday,
when for the sake of the outlying population the two services are
brought near together in the middle of the day, was usually
deferred till the ordinary supper hour. It was evident that the
tone of the day was changed. Children were not so strictly held in.
There was no loud talking, nor was laughing allowed, but a general
feeling sprung up around the table that the severer tasks of the
day were ended.</p>
<p>Devout and age-sobered people sat in a kind of golden twilight
of meditation. The minister, in his well-ordered house, tired with
a double service, mingled thoughts both glad and sad. His tasks
were ended. He was conscious that he had manfully done his best.
But that best doing, as he reflected upon it, seemed so poor, so
unworthy of the nobleness of the theme, and so relatively powerless
upon the stubborn stuff of which his people's dispositions were
made, that there remained a vague, unquiet sense of blame upon his
conscience.</p>
<p>It was Dr. Wentworth's habit to walk with his family in the
garden, early in the morning and late in the afternoon. If early,
Rose was usually his company; in the afternoon the whole family,
Agate Bissell always excepted. She had in full measure that
peculiar New England feeling that Sunday is to be kept by staying
in the house, except such time as is spent at church. And though
she never, impliedly even, rebuked the doctor's resort to his
garden, it was plain that deep down in her heart she thought it an
improper way of spending Sunday; and in that view she had the
secret sympathy of almost all the noteworthy villagers. Had any
one, upon that day, made Agate a visit, unless for some plain end
of necessity or mercy, she would have deemed it a personal
affront.</p>
<p>Sunday was the Lord's day. Agate acted as if any use of it for
her own pleasure would be literal and downright stealing.</p>
<p>"We have six days for our own work. We ought not to begrudge the
Lord one whole day."</p>
<p>Two circumstances distressed honest Agate's conscience. The one
was that the incursion of summer visitors from the city was tending
manifestly to relax the Sabbath, especially after the church
services. The other was that Dr. Wentworth would occasionally allow
Judge Bacon to call in and discuss with him topics suggested by the
sermons. She once expressed herself in this wise:--</p>
<p>"Either Sunday is worth keeping, or it is not. If you do keep
it, it ought to be strictly done. But lately Sunday is raveling out
at the end. We take it on like a summer dress, which in the morning
is clean and sweet, but at night it is soiled at the bottom and
much rumpled all over."</p>
<p>Dr. Wentworth sat with Rose on one side and her mother on the
other, in the honeysuckle corner, where the west could be seen,
great trees lying athwart the horizon and checkering the golden
light with their dark masses. Judge Bacon had turned the
conversation upon this very topic.</p>
<p>"I think our Sundays in New England are Puritan and Jewish more
than Christian. They are days of restriction rather than of
joyousness. They are fast days, not feast days."</p>
<p>"Do you say that as a mere matter of historical criticism, or do
you think that they could be improved practically?"</p>
<p>"Both. It is susceptible of proof that the early Christian
Sunday was a day of triumph and of much social joy. It would be
well if we could follow primitive example."</p>
<p>"Judge, I am hardly of your opinion. I should be unwilling to
see our New England Sunday changed, except perhaps by a larger
social liberty <i>in</i> each family. Much might be done to make it
attractive to children, and relieve older persons from
<i>ennui</i>. But after all, we must judge things by their fruits.
If you bring me good apples, it is in vain to abuse the tree as
craggy, rude, or homely. The fruit redeems the tree."</p>
<p>"A very comely figure, Doctor, but not very good reasoning. New
England has had something at work upon her beside her Sundays. What
you call the 'fruit' grew, a good deal of it at any rate, on other
trees than Sunday trees."</p>
<p>"You are only partly right. New England character and history
are the result of a wide-spread system of influences of which the
Sabbath day was the type--and not only so, but the grand motive
power. Almost every cause which has worked benignly among us has
received its inspiration and impulse largely from this One Solitary
Day of the week.</p>
<p>"It is true that all the vegetable growths that we see about us
here depend upon a great variety of causes; but there is one cause
that is the condition of power in every other, and that is the Sun!
And so, many as have been the influences working at New England
character, Sunday has been a generic and multiplex force, inspiring
and directing all others. It is indeed the <i>Sun's</i> day.</p>
<p>"It is a little singular that, borrowing the name from the
heathen calendar, it should have tallied so well with the Scripture
name, the Lord's day--that Lord who was the Morning Star in early
day, and at length the Sun of Righteousness!</p>
<p>"The Jews called it the Sabbath--a day of rest. Modern
Christians call it the <i>Sun's</i> day, or the day of light,
warmth, and growth. If this seems fanciful so far as the names of
the day are concerned, it is strikingly characteristic of the real
spirit of the two days, in the ancient and modern dispensation. I
doubt if the old Jews ever kept a Sabbath religiously, as we
understand that term. Indeed, I suspect there was not yet a
religious strength in that national character that could hold up
religious feeling without the help of social and even physical
adjuvants. Their religious days were either fasts or like our
Thanksgiving days. But the higher and richer moral nature which has
been developed by Christianity enables communities to sustain one
day in seven upon a high spiritual plane, with the need of but very
little social help, and without the feasting element at all."</p>
<p>"That may be very well for a few saints like you and me, Doctor,
but it is too high for the majority of men. Common people find the
strict Sundays a great annoyance, and clandestinely set them
aside."</p>
<p>"I doubt it. There are a few in every society that live by their
sensuous nature. Sunday must be a dead day to them--a dark room. No
wonder they break through. But it is not so with the sturdy,
unsophisticated laboring class in New England. If it came to a
vote, you would find that the farmers of New England would be the
defenders of the day, even if screwed up to the old strictness.
Their instinct is right. It is an observance that has always worked
its best effects upon the common people, and if I were to change
the name, I should call Sunday THE POOR MAN'S DAY.</p>
<p>"Men do not yet perceive that the base of the brain is full of
despotism, and the coronal brain is radiant with liberty. I mean
that the laws and relations which grow out of men's relations in
physical things are the sternest and hardest, and at every step in
the assent toward reason and spirituality, the relations grow more
kindly and free.</p>
<p>"Now, it is natural for men to prefer an animal life. By-and-by
they will learn that such a life necessitates force, absolutism. It
is natural for unreflecting men to complain when custom or
institutions hold them up to some higher degree. But that higher
degree has in it an element of emancipation from the necessary
despotisms of physical life. If it were possible to bring the whole
community up to a plane of spirituality, it would be found that
there and there only could be the highest measure of liberty. And
this is my answer to those who grumble at the restriction of Sunday
liberty. It is only the liberty of the senses that suffers. A
higher and nobler civil liberty, moral liberty, social liberty,
will work out of it. Sunday is the common people's Magna
Charta."</p>
<p>"Well done, Doctor! I give up. Hereafter you shall see me
radiant on Sunday. I must not get my hay in if storms do threaten
to spoil it; but I shall give my conscience a hitch up, and take it
out in that. I must not ride out; but then I shall regard every
virtuous self-denial as a moral investment with good dividends
coming in by-and-by. I can't let the children frolic in the front
dooryard; but then, while they sit waiting for the sun to go down,
and your <i>Sun</i>-day to be over, I shall console myself that
they are one notch nearer an angelic condition every week. But
good-night, good-night, Mrs. Wentworth. I hope you may not become
so spiritual as quite to disdain the body. I really think, for this
world, the body has some respectable uses yet. Good-night, Rose.
The angels take care of you, if there is one of them good
enough."</p>
<p>And so the judge left.</p>
<p>They sat silently looking at the sun, now but just above the
horizon. A few scarfs of cloud, brilliant with flame-color, and
every moment changing forms, seemed like winged spirits, half
revealed, that hovered round the retiring orb.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wentworth at length broke the silence.</p>
<p>"I always thought, Doctor, that you believed Sunday
over-strictly kept, and that you were in favor of relaxation."</p>
<p>"I am. Just as fast as you can make it a day of real religious
enjoyment, it will relax itself. True and deep spiritual feeling is
the freest of all experiences. And it reconciles in itself the most
perfect consciousness of liberty with the most thorough observance
of outward rules and proprieties. Liberty is not an outward
condition. It is an inward attribute, or rather a name for the
quality of life produced by the highest moral attributes. When
communities come to that condition, we shall see fewer laws and
higher morality.</p>
<p>"The one great poem of New England is her Sunday! Through that
she has escaped materialism. That has been a crystal dome overhead,
through which Imagination has been kept alive. New England's
imagination is to be found, not in art and literature, but in her
inventions, her social organism, and above all in her religious
life. The Sabbath has been the nurse of that. When she ceases to
have a Sunday, she will be as this landscape is:--now growing dark,
all its lines blurred, its distances and gradations fast merging
into sheeted darkness and night. Come, let us go in!"</p>

<h2>LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN</h2>
<h3>(1770-1827)</h3>
<center>BY E. IREN&AElig;US STEVENSON</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-w.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>e are warned on high authority that no man can serve two
masters. The caution should obtain in &aelig;sthetics as well as in
ethics. As a general rule, the painter must stick to his easel, the
sculptor must carve, the musician must score or play or sing, the
actor must act,--each with no more than the merest coquettings with
sister arts. Otherwise his genius is apt to suffer from what are
side-issues for temperament. To many minds a taste, and even a
singular capacity, for an avocation has injured the work done in
the real vocation.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-321.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Beethoven.</b></p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions. The versatility has not always
been fatal. We recall Leonardo, Angelo, Rossetti, and Blake among
painters; in the ranks of musicians we note Hoffmann, Berlioz,
Schumann, Wagner, Boito. In other art-paths, such personal pages as
those of Cellini, and the critical writings of Story, of to-day,
may add their evidence. The essentially autobiographic in such a
connection must be accepted with reserve. So must be taken much
admirable writing as to the art in which the critic or teacher has
labored. Didactics are not necessarily literature. Perhaps the best
basis of determining the right to literary recognition of men and
women who have written and printed more or less without actually
professing letters, will be the interest of the matter they have
left to the kind of reader who does not care a pin about their real
life-work, or about their self-expression as it really comes down
to us.</p>
<p>In painting, the dual capacity--for the brush and for
letters--has more shining examples than in music. But with
Beethoven, Schumann, Boito, and Wagner, comes a striking succession
of men who, as to autobiography or criticism or verse, present a
high quality of interest to the general reader. In the instance of
Beethoven the critical or essayistic side is limited. It is by his
letters and diary that we study (only less vividly than in his
music) a character of profound depth and imposing nobility; a
nature of exquisite sensitiveness. In them we follow, if
fragmentarily, the battle of personality against environment, the
secrets of strong but high passion, the artist
temperament,--endowed with a dignity and a moral majesty seldom
equaled in an art indeed called divine, but with children who
frequently remind us that Pan absorbed in playing his syrinx has a
goat's hoof.</p>
<p>Beethoven in all his correspondence wrote himself down as what
he was,--a superior man, a mighty soul in many traits, as well as a
supreme creative musician. His letters are absorbing, whether they
breathe love or anger, discouragement or joy, rebellion against
untoward conditions of daily life or solemn resignation. The
religious quality, too, is strong in them; that element more in
touch with Deism than with one or another orthodoxy. Withal, he is
as sincere in every line of such matter as he was in the spoken
word. His correspondence holds up the mirror to his own nature,
with its extremes of impulse and reserve, of affection and
austerity, of confidence and suspicion. It abounds, too, in that
brusque yet seldom coarse humor which leaps up in the Finale of the
Seventh Symphony, in the Eighth Symphony's waggery, the last
movement of the Concerto in E flat. They offer likewise verbal
admissions of such depression of heart as we recognize in the
sternest episodes of the later Sonatas and of the Galitzin
Quartets, and in the awful Allegretto of the Symphony in A. They
hint at the amorous passion of the slow movements of the Fourth and
Ninth Symphonies, at the moral heroism of the Fifth, at the more
human courage of the 'Heroic,' at the mysticism of the Ninth's
tremendous opening. In interesting relation to the group, and
merely of superficial interest, are his hasty notes, his occasional
efforts to write in English or in French, his touches of musical
allusiveness.</p>

Photogravure from the Original Painting by C. J&auml;ger.</p>
<br>
<p>It is not in the purpose of these prefatory paragraphs to a
too-brief group of Beethoven's letters to enter upon his biography.
That is essentially a musician's life; albeit the life of a
musician who, as Mr. Edward Dannreuther suggests, leaves behind him
the domain of mere art and enters upon that of the seer and the
prophet. He was born in Bonn in 1770, on a day the date of which is
not certain (though we know that his baptism was December 17th).
His youth was not a sunshiny period. Poverty, neglect, a drunken
father, violin lessons under compulsion, were the circumstances
ushering him into his career. He was for a brief time a pupil of
Mozart; just enough so to preserve that succession of royal
geniuses expressed in linking Mozart to Haydn, and in remembering
that Liszt played for Beethoven and that Schubert stood beside
Beethoven's last sick-bed. High patronage and interest gradually
took the composer under its care. Austria and Germany recognized
him, England accepted him early, universal intelligence became
enthusiastic over utterances in art that seemed as much innovations
as Wagneristic writing seemed to the next generation. In Vienna,
Beethoven may be said to have passed his life. There were the
friends to whom he wrote--who understood and loved him. Afflicted
early with a deafness that became total,--the irony of fate,--the
majority of his master-works were evolved from a mind shut away
from the pleasures and disturbances of earthly sounds, and beset by
invalidism and suffering. Naturally genial, he grew morbidly
sensitive. Infirmities of temper as well as of body marked him for
their own. But underneath all superficial shortcomings of his
intensely human nature was a Shakespearean dignity of moral and
intellectual individuality.</p>
<p>It is not necessary here even to touch on the works that follow
him. They stand now as firmly as ever--perhaps more firmly--in the
honor and the affection of all the world of auditors in touch with
the highest expressions in the tone-world. The mere mention of such
monuments as the sonatas, the nine symphonies, the Mass in D minor,
the magnificent chain of overtures, the dramatic concert-arias,
does not exhaust the list. They are the vivid self-expressions of
one who learned in suffering what he taught in song: a man whose
personality impressed itself into almost everything that he wrote,
upon almost every one whom he met, and who towers up as
impressively as the author of 'Hamlet,' the sculptor of 'Moses,'
the painter of 'The Last Supper.'</p>
<p>It is perhaps interesting to mention that the very chirography
of Beethoven's letters is eloquent of the man. Handwriting is apt
to be. Mendelssohn, the well-balanced, the precise, wrote like
copper-plate. Wagner wrote a fine strong hand, seldom with
erasures. Spontini, the soldier-like, wrote with the decision of a
soldier. Beethoven's letters and notes are in a large, open,
dashing hand, often scrawls, always with the blackest of ink, full
of changes, and not a flourish to spare--the handwriting of impulse
and carelessness as to form, compared with a writer's desire of
making his meaning clear.</p>

<br>
<center>VIENNA, June 29th, 1800.</center>
<br>
<p><i>My dear and valued Wegeler:</i></p>
<p>How much I thank you for your remembrance of me, little as I
deserve it or have sought to deserve it; and yet you are so kind
that you allow nothing, not even my unpardonable neglect, to
discourage you, always remaining the same true, good, and faithful
friend. That I can ever forget you or yours, once so dear and
precious to me, do not for a moment believe. There are times when I
find myself longing to see you again, and wishing that I could go
to stay with you. My fatherland, that lovely region where I first
saw the light, is still as distinct and beauteous in my eyes as
when I quitted you; in short, I shall esteem the time when I once
more see you, and again greet Father Rhine, as one of the happiest
periods of my life. When this may be I cannot yet tell, but at all
events I may say that you shall not see me again till I have become
not only eminent as an artist, but better and more perfect as a
man; and if the condition of our fatherland be then more
prosperous, my art shall be entirely devoted to the benefit of the
poor. Oh, blissful moment!--how happy do I esteem myself that I can
expedite it and bring it to pass!</p>
<p>You desire to know something of my position: well! it is by no
means bad. However incredible it may appear, I must tell you that
Lichnowsky has been, and still is, my warmest friend (slight
dissensions occurred occasionally between us, and yet they only
served to strengthen our friendship). He settled on me last year
the sum of six hundred florins, for which I am to draw on him till
I can procure some suitable situation. My compositions are very
profitable, and I may really say that I have almost more
commissions than it is possible for me to execute. I can have six
or seven publishers or more for every piece if I choose: they no
longer bargain with me--I demand, and they pay--so you see this is
a very good thing. For instance, I have a friend in distress, and
my purse does not admit of my assisting him at once, but I have
only to sit down and write, and in a short time he is relieved. I
am also become more economical than formerly....</p>
<p>To give you some idea of my extraordinary deafness, I must tell
you that in the theatre I am obliged to lean close up against the
orchestra in order to understand the actors, and when a little way
off I hear none of the high notes of instruments or singers. It is
most astonishing that in conversation some people never seem to
observe this; as I am subject to fits of absence, they attribute it
to that cause. Often I can scarcely hear a person if he speaks low;
I can distinguish the tones but not the words, and yet I feel it
intolerable if any one shouts to me. Heaven alone knows how it is
to end! Vering declares that I shall certainly improve, even if I
be not entirely restored. How often have I cursed my existence!
Plutarch led me to resignation. I shall strive if possible to set
Fate at defiance, although there must be moments in my life when I
cannot fail to be the most unhappy of God's creatures. I entreat
you to say nothing of my affliction to any one, not even to
Lorchen. I confide the secret to you alone, and entreat you some
day to correspond with Vering on the subject. If I continue in the
same state, I shall come to you in the ensuing spring, when you
must engage a house for me somewhere in the country, amid beautiful
scenery, and I shall then become a rustic for a year, which may
perhaps effect a change. Resignation!--what a miserable refuge! and
yet it is my sole remaining one. You will forgive my thus appealing
to your kindly sympathies at a time when your own position is sad
enough.</p>
<p>Farewell, my kind, faithful Wegeler! Rest assured of the love
and friendship of your</p>

<center><b>FROM THE LETTERS TO BETTINA BRENTANO</b></center>
<br>
<p>Never was there a lovelier spring than this year; I say so, and
feel it too, because it was then I first knew you. You have
yourself seen that in society I am like a fish on the sand, which
writhes and writhes, but cannot get away till some benevolent
Galatea casts it back into the mighty ocean. I was indeed fairly
stranded, dearest friend, when surprised by you at a moment in
which moroseness had entirely mastered me; but how quickly it
vanished at your aspect! I was at once conscious that you came from
another sphere than this absurd world, where, with the best
inclinations, I cannot open my ears. I am a wretched creature, and
yet I complain of others!! You will forgive this from the goodness
of heart that beams in your eyes, and the good sense manifested by
your ears; at least they understand how to flatter, by the mode in
which they listen. My ears are, alas! a partition-wall, through
which I can with difficulty hold any intercourse with my
fellow-creatures. Otherwise perhaps I might have felt more assured
with you; but I was only conscious of the full, intelligent glance
from your eyes, which affected me so deeply that never can I forget
it. My dear friend! dearest girl!--Art! who comprehends it? with
whom can I discuss this mighty goddess? How precious to me were the
few days when we talked together, or, I should rather say,
corresponded! I have carefully preserved the little notes with your
clever, charming, most charming answers; so I have to thank my
defective hearing for the greater part of our fugitive intercourse
being written down. Since you left this I have had some unhappy
hours,--hours of the deepest gloom, when I could do nothing. I
wandered for three hours in the Sch&ouml;nbrunn All&eacute;e after
you left us, but no <i>angel</i> met me there to take possession of
me as you did. Pray forgive, my dear friend, this deviation from
the original key, but I must have such intervals as a relief to my
heart. You have no doubt written to Goethe about me? I would gladly
bury my head in a sack, so that I might neither see nor hear what
goes on in the world, because I shall meet you there no more; but I
shall get a letter from you? Hope sustains me, as it does half the
world; through life she has been my close companion, or what would
have become of me? I send you 'Kennst Du das Land,' written with my
own hand, as a remembrance of the hour when I first knew
you....</p>
<p>If you mention me when you write to Goethe, strive to find words
expressive of my deep reverence and admiration. I am about to write
to him myself with regard to 'Egmont,' for which I have written
some music solely from my love for his poetry, which always
delights me. Who can be sufficiently grateful to a great poet,--the
most precious jewel of a nation!</p>
<blockquote>Kings and princes can indeed create professors and
privy-councillors, and confer titles and decorations, but they
cannot make great men,--spirits that soar above the base turmoil of
this world. There their powers fail, and this it is that forces
them to respect us. When two persons like Goethe and myself meet,
these grandees cannot fail to perceive what such as we consider
great. Yesterday on our way home we met the whole Imperial family;
we saw them coming some way off, when Goethe withdrew his arm from
mine, in order to stand aside; and say what I would, I could not
prevail on him to make another step in advance. I pressed down my
hat more firmly on my head, buttoned up my great-coat, and crossing
my arms behind me, I made my way through the thickest portion of
the crowd. Princes and courtiers formed a lane for me; Archduke
Rudolph took off his hat, and the Empress bowed to me first. These
great ones of the earth <i>know me</i>. To my infinite amusement, I
saw the procession defile past Goethe, who stood aside with his hat
off, bowing profoundly. I afterwards took him sharply to task for
this; I gave him no quarter and upbraided him with all his
sins.</blockquote>

<p>You grieve! dearest of all beings! I have just heard that the
letters must be sent off very early. Mondays and Thursdays are the
only days when the post goes to K---- from here. You grieve! Ah!
where I am, there you are ever with me: how earnestly shall I
strive to pass my life with you, and what a life will it be!!!
Whereas now!! without you!! and persecuted by the kindness of
others, which I neither deserve nor try to deserve! The servility
of man towards his fellow-man pains me, and when I regard myself as
a component part of the universe, what am I, what is he who is
called the greatest?--and yet herein are displayed the godlike
feelings of humanity!--I weep in thinking that you will receive no

love me, I love you more fondly still. Never conceal your feelings
from me. Good-night! As a patient at these baths, I must now go to

whether Fate will hear us. I must live either wholly with you, or
not at all. Indeed, I have resolved to wander far from you till the
moment arrives when I can fly into your arms, and feel that they
are my home, and send forth my soul in unison with yours into the
realm of spirits. Alas! it must be so! You will take courage, for
you know my fidelity. Never can another possess my heart--never,
never! Oh, heavens! Why must I fly from her I so fondly love? and
yet my existence in W--was as miserable as here. Your love made me
the most happy and yet the most unhappy of men. At my age, life
requires a uniform equality; can this be found in our mutual
relations? My angel! I have this moment heard that the post goes
every day, so I must conclude that you may get this letter the
sooner. Be calm! for we can only attain our object of living
together by the calm contemplation of our existence. Continue to
love me. Yesterday, to-day, what longings for you, what tears for
you! for you! for you! my life! my all! Farewell! Oh, love me for

<center><b>TO MY BROTHERS CARL AND JOHANN BEETHOVEN</b></center>
<br>
<center>HEILIGENSTADT, Oct. 6th, 1802.</center>
<br>
<p>Oh! Ye who think or declare me to be hostile, morose, and
misanthropical, how unjust you are, and how little you know the
secret cause of what appears thus to you! My heart and mind were
ever from childhood prone to the most tender feelings of affection,
and I was always disposed to accomplish something great. But you
must remember that six years ago I was attacked by an incurable
malady, aggravated by unskillful physicians, deluded from year to
year, too, by the hope of relief, and at length forced to the
conviction of a <i>lasting affliction</i> (the cure of which may go
on for years, and perhaps after all prove impracticable).</p>
<p>Born with a passionate and excitable temperament, keenly
susceptible to the pleasures of society, I was yet obliged early in
life to isolate myself, and to pass my existence in solitude. If I
at any time resolved to surmount all this, oh! how cruelly was I
again repelled by the experience, sadder than ever, of my defective
hearing!--and yet I found it impossible to say to others: Speak
louder, shout! for I am deaf! Alas! how could I proclaim the
deficiency of a sense which ought to have been more perfect with me
than with other men--a sense which I once possessed in the highest
perfection, to an extent indeed that few of my profession ever
enjoyed! Alas! I cannot do this! Forgive me therefore when you see
me withdraw from you with whom I would so gladly mingle. My
misfortune is doubly severe from causing me to be misunderstood. No
longer can I enjoy recreation in social intercourse, refined
conversation, or mutual outpourings of thought. Completely
isolated, I only enter society when compelled to do so. I must live
like an exile. In company I am assailed by the most painful
apprehensions, from the dread of being exposed to the risk of my
condition being observed. It was the same during the last six
months I spent in the country. My intelligent physician recommended
me to spare my hearing as much as possible, which was quite in
accordance with my present disposition, though sometimes, tempted
by my natural inclination for society, I allowed myself to be
beguiled into it. But what humiliation when any one beside me heard
a flute in the far distance, while I heard <i>nothing</i>, or when
others heard <i>a shepherd singing</i>, and I still heard
<i>nothing!</i> Such things brought me to the verge of desperation,
and well-nigh caused me to put an end to my life. <i>Art! art</i>
alone, deterred me. Ah! how could I possibly quit the world before
bringing forth all that I felt it was my vocation to produce? And
thus I spared this miserable life--so utterly miserable that any
sudden change may reduce me at any moment from my best condition
into the worst. It is decreed that I must now choose
<i>Patience</i> for my guide! This I have done. I hope the resolve
will not fail me, steadfastly to persevere till it may please the
inexorable Fates to cut the thread of my life. Perhaps I may get
better, perhaps not. I am prepared for either. Constrained to
become a philosopher in my twenty-eighth year! This is no slight
trial, and more severe on an artist than on any one else. God looks
into my heart, he searches it, and knows that love for man and
feelings of benevolence have their abode there! Oh! ye who may one
day read this, think that you have done me injustice; and let any
one similarly afflicted be consoled by finding one like himself,
who, in defiance of all the obstacles of nature, has done all in
his power to be included in the ranks of estimable artists and men.
My brothers Carl and Johann, as soon as I am no more, if Professor
Schmidt be still alive, beg him in my name to describe my malady,
and to add these pages to the analysis of my disease, that at
least, so far as possible, the world may be reconciled to me after
my death. I also hereby declare you both heirs of my small fortune
(if so it may be called). Share it fairly, agree together and
assist each other. You know that anything you did to give me pain
has been long forgiven. I thank you, my brother Carl in particular,
for the attachment you have shown me of late. My wish is that you
may enjoy a happier life, and one more free from care than mine has
been. Recommend <i>Virtue</i> to your children; that alone, and not
wealth, can insure happiness. I speak from experience. It was
<i>Virtue</i> alone which sustained me in my misery; I have to
thank her and Art for not having ended my life by suicide.
Farewell! Love each other. I gratefully thank all my friends,
especially Prince Lichnowsky and Professor Schmidt. I wish one of
you to keep Prince L--'s instruments; but I trust this will give
rise to no dissension between you. If you think it more beneficial,
however, you have only to dispose of them. How much I shall rejoice
if I can serve you even in the grave! So be it then! I joyfully
hasten to meet Death. If he comes before I have had the opportunity
of developing all my artistic powers, then, notwithstanding my
cruel fate, he will come too early for me, and I should wish for
him at a more distant period; but even then I shall be content, for
his advent will release me from a state of endless suffering. Come
when he may, I shall meet him with courage. Farewell! Do not quite
forget me, even in death: I deserve this from you, because during
my life I so often thought of you, and wished to make you happy.
Amen!</p>

<p>Thus, then, I take leave of you, and with sadness too. The fond
hope I brought with me here, of being to a certain degree cured,
now utterly forsakes me. As autumn leaves fall and wither, so are
my hopes blighted. Almost as I came, I depart. Even the lofty
courage that so often animated me in the lovely days of summer is
gone forever. O Providence! vouchsafe me one day of pure felicity!
How long have I been estranged from the glad echo of true joy!
When! O my God! when shall I again feel it in the temple of nature

<p>The welfare of my nephew is dearer to my heart than it can be to

will become crooked and outgrow the gardener's training hand, and
upright bearing, intellect, and character be destroyed for
ever....</p>
<p>I know no duty more sacred than the education and training of a
child. The chief duties of a guardian consist in knowing how to
appreciate what is good, and in adopting a right course; then alone
has proper attention been devoted to the welfare of his ward,
whereas in opposing what is good he neglects his duty.</p>
<p>Indeed, keeping in view what is most for the benefit of the boy,
I do not object to the mother in so far sharing in the duties of a
guardian, that she may visit her son, and see him, and be apprised
of all the measures adopted for his education; but to intrust her
with his sole guardianship without a strict guardian by her side
would cause the irretrievable ruin of her son.</p>
<p>On these cogent grounds I reiterate my well-founded

the welfare of my nephew alone guides my steps in this affair.</p>

the bell; otherwise it might have been at once removed and sent to
me in town, as they have no right whatever to retain it. Be this as
it may, I am quite determined not to leave the bell there, for I
require one here, and therefore intend to use the one in question

<a name="BELLMAN"></a>
<h2>CARL MICHAEL BELLMAN</h2>
<h3>(1740-1795)</h3>
<center>BY OLGA FLINCH</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-c.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>arl Michael Bellman was born in Stockholm on the 4th of
February, 1740. His father, son of a professor at Upsala
University, held a government office; of his mother he wrote that
she was "fair as day, unspeakably good, dressed prettily, was kind
to everybody, of a refined nature, and had an excellent voice."
From her he undoubtedly inherited the warm, genial heart which
beats in every one of his songs. His father's house was the
rendezvous of many of the noted men of the day, among them the poet
Dalin, who was then at the zenith of his popularity. The boy's
unusual gifts were early recognized, and everything was done to
give him the best instruction, especially after an attack of fever,
during which he not only spoke in rhyme, but sang his first
improvised songs in a clear, true voice. The tutor who was then
chosen taught him, "besides the art of making verse," English,
French, German, and Italian; and he progressed far enough in these
studies to translate several German hymns and religious and
philosophic essays, no doubt influenced in this choice of subjects
by the religious atmosphere of his home. Moreover, he taught
himself to play the zither, and very soon began to pick out his own
melodies as an accompaniment to his songs. The instrument he used
had been brought home from Italy by his grandfather, became his
closest companion throughout life, and is now kept at the Royal
Academy of Arts at Stockholm.</p>
<p>At eighteen he entered the University of Upsala, and while there
wrote a satirical poem, "The Moon," which he submitted to the
criticism of Dalin, who however made but a single correction. It
was written in the manner of Dalin, and he continued to be
influenced by the latter until his twenty-fifth year. At this time,
and within the same year, his father and mother died, and seeking
among his friends the social stimulus which his nature craved, he
became a frequent guest at the inns in the company of Hallman and
Krexel, who were making their mark by their poetic and dramatic
writings. It was then that his peculiar talent came to its own; he
threw away all foreign influence and began to sing his songs, born
of the impression of the moment and full of the charm of
spontaneity. Some of them he jotted down quickly, most of them he
sang to the sound of his zither, often fashioning them to suit
well-known melodies, and again creating the melody with the words,
for the greater part set in a form of verse not previously used.
And so inseparably linked are words and melody, that it has not
occurred to any one to set any other music to Bellman's songs than
what he originally chose. He took all his characters out of the
life he saw around him; and with the appreciation of the man to
whom the present is everything, he seized the charm of the fleeting
moment and expressed it with such simplicity and truth, and deep
feeling withal, that it stands forth immortally fresh and young. A
number of these songs have probably been lost; he had no thirst for
fame, and took no pains to circulate them, but they found their way
to the public in written copies and cheap prints, and his name was
soon known throughout the country.</p>
<p>This way of living and singing like the birds of the air was,
however, not very conducive to the satisfaction of material wants.
He had made two attempts to go into business, but the more he was
seen at the inns, the less he was seen at his business.</p>
<p>Fortunately for him, Gustavus III., who was himself a poet,
became at this time king of Sweden. He was an adherent of the
French school of poetry, and Bellman's muse could hardly be said to
belong to this: but with considerable talent as a dramatic writer,
Gustavus appreciated the dramatic quality in Bellman's songs; and
when Bellman sent him a rhymed petition, still kept, in which he
wrote that "if his Majesty would not most graciously give him an
office, he would most obediently be obliged to starve to death
before Christmas," the king made him secretary of the lottery, with
the title of court secretary, and a yearly income of three thousand
dollars. Bellman promptly gave half of this to an assistant, who
did the work, and continued his troubadour life on the other half
with a superb disdain of future needs. His affairs so well in
order, he could afford to get married; and chose for his wife
Lovisa Gr&ouml;nlund, a girl of a bright intellect and strong
character, of which she ultimately had great need, the
responsibilities of their married life being left altogether to
her.</p>
<p>Bellman was now at his best; about this time he wrote most of
'Fredman's Songs' and 'Actions concerning the Chapter of Bacchus
order.' both rich in lyric gems; he was the favorite companion of
the King, to whom his devotion was boundless, and he was happy in
his chosen friends whose company inspired him. Nevertheless he was
now, as ever, in need of money. Atterbom tells that "One day the
King met him on the street, so poorly dressed that he instinctively
exclaimed, 'My dear Bellman, how poorly you are clad!' The poet
answered with a bow, 'I can nevertheless most obediently assure
your Majesty that I am wearing my entire wardrobe.'" His ready wit
never left him. "How goes the world with you?" asked the King once
when they met; "you don't look to me as if you could turn a single
rhyme to-day." The poet bowed and replied on the spur of the
moment:--</p>
<blockquote>"No scrip my purse doth hold;<br>
My lyre's unstrung, alas!<br>
But yet upon my glass<br>
Stands Gustaf's name in gold."</blockquote>
<p>Another time the King sent his men for him, with the order to
bring him in whatever condition they found him. "He was found not
entirely free from drink, and not very presentable, but was
nevertheless carried off, zither and all, to Haga Castle, where he
drank some champagne, sang some songs, drank a little more, and
finally fell asleep. The King left him so to go to his supper; and
when he returned and found his guest still sleeping, he remarked,
'I wonder what Bellman would say if I awoke him now and asked him
to give me a song.' The poet sat up, blinked with his eyes, and
said, 'Then Bellman would say,--listen;' whereupon he sang to the
tune of 'Malbrouck s'en va-t-en guerre':--</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Oh, so heavily, heavily trailing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds over Haga are sailing,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go,
King, thy rest is dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go,
King, thy respite taking,<br>
Rest softly, rest softly, then waking,<br>
When dawn through the darkness is breaking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy people with mild rule thou
cheer!'</blockquote>
<p>Then he fell into his former position again, and was carried
home asleep with a little gift in his hand."</p>
<p>The task of collecting, preserving, and publishing his works
fell entirely upon his friends; if it had depended on him, they
would probably never have been collected, much less published.</p>
<p>During the last fifteen years of his life, from 1780 to 1795,
his health grew very poor. In 1791 he was invited to be present at
the distribution of degrees at Upsala, and at the dinner he
returned a toast with a song born of the moment; but his voice had
grown so weak from lung trouble that only those nearest to him
could hear him. To add to his sufferings, he had to meet the great
sorrow of his King's death at the hand of a murderer, and his poem
on the 'Death and Memory of the King' was not of a nature to make
friends for him at the new court. Thus it happened that, poor and
broken in health, he was put into the debtor's prison in the very
castle where he had been so happy a guest. Hallman and Krexel and
others of his best friends, as devoted to him as ever, were unable
to obtain his release; but he was at last bailed out by some one,
who as recompense asked him to sing one of his jolly songs, and in
his poor broken voice he sang. 'Drink out thy glass, see, Death
awaits thee.' Atterbom remarks about the man in question, "And
maybe he did not find that song so jolly after all."</p>
<p>While in prison he sent in a petition to the King,--somewhat
different from his first petition to Gustavus III.,--in which he
asked permission to live in the castle until his death. The
following is one of the verses:--</p>
<blockquote>"Spring commands; the birds are singing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bees are swarming, fishes play;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now and then the zephyrs stray,<br>
Breath of life the poet bringing.<br>
Lift my load of sorrow clinging,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spare me one small nook, I pray."</blockquote>
<p>Of his death Atterbom writes as follows:--</p>
<blockquote>"He had been the favorite of the nation and the King,
content with the mere necessities of life, free from every care,
not even desiring the immortality of fame; moderate in everything
except in enthusiasm, he had enjoyed to the full what he
wanted,--friendship, wine, and music. Now he lived to see the
shadows fall over his life and genius. Feeling that his last hour
was not far off, he sent word to his nearest friends that a meeting
with them as in old times would be dear to him. He came to meet
them almost a shadow, but with his old friendly smile; even in the
toasts he took part, however moderately, and then he announced that
he would let them 'hear Bellman once more.' The spirit of song took
possession of him, more powerfully than ever, and all the rays of
his dying imagination were centred in an improvised good-by song.
Throughout an entire night, under continual inspiration, he sang
his happy life, his mild King's glory, his gratitude to Providence,
who let him be born among a noble people in this beautiful Northern
country,--finally he gave his grateful good-by to every one
present, in a separate strophe and melody expressing the peculiar
individuality of the one addressed and his relation to the poet.
His friends begged him with tears to stop, and spare his already
much weakened lungs; but he replied, 'Let us die, as we have lived,
in music!'--emptied his last glass of champagne, and began at dawn
the last verse of his song."</blockquote>
<p>After this he sang no more. A few days later he went to bed,
lingered for ten weeks, and died on the 11th of February, 1795,
aged fifty-four years. He was buried in Clara cemetery.</p>
<p>Bellman's critics have given themselves much trouble about his
personal character. Some have thought him little better than a
coarse drunkard; others again have made him out a cynic who sneered
at the life he depicted; again others have laid the weight on the
note found in 'Drink out thy glass,' and have seen only the
underlying sad pathos of his songs. His contemporaries agree that
he was a man of great consideration for form, and assert that if
there are coarse passages in his songs it is because they only
could express what he depicted. All coarseness was foreign to his
nature; he was reserved and somewhat shy, and only in the company
of his chosen few did he open his heart.</p>
<p>His critics have, moreover, assiduously sought the moral of his
works. If any was intended, it may have been that of fighting
sentimentality and all false feeling; but it seems more in
accordance with his entire life that he sang out of the fullness of
his heart, as a bird sings, simply because it must sing.</p>

<h2>JEREMY BENTHAM</h2>
<h3>(1748-1832)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-b.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>entham, whose name rightly stands sponsor for the utilitarian
theory of morals in legislation, though not its originator, was a
mighty and unique figure in many ways. His childhood reminds us of
that of his disciple John Stuart Mill in its precocity; but
fortunately for him, life had more juice in it for young Bentham
than it had for Mill. In his maturity and old age he was widely
recognized as a commanding authority, notwithstanding some
startling absurdities.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-347.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Jeremy Bentham.</b></p>
<p>He was born in London, February 15th, 1747-8; the child of an
attorney of ample means, who was proud of the youth, and did not
hesitate to show him off. In his fourth year he began the study of
Latin, and a year later was known in his father's circle as "the
philosopher." At six or seven he began the study of French. He was
then sent to Westminster school, where he must have had a rather
uncomfortable time; for he was small in body, sensitive and
delicate, and not fond of boyish sports. He had a much happier life
at the houses of his grandmothers at Barking and at Browning Hill,
where much of his childhood was spent. His reminiscences of these
days, as related to his biographer, are full of charm. He was a
great reader and a great student; and going to Oxford early, was
only sixteen when he took his degree.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that he did not bear away with him a high
appreciation of the benefits which he owed to his alma mater.
"Mendacity and insincerity--- in these I found the effects, the
sure and only sure effects, of an English university education." He
wrote a Latin ode on the death of George II., which was much
praised. In later years he himself said of it, "It was a mediocre
performance on a trumpery subject, written by a miserable
child."</p>
<p>On taking his degree he entered at Lincoln's Inn, but he never
made a success in the practice of the law. He hated litigation, and
his mind became immediately absorbed in the study and development
of the principles of legislation and jurisprudence, and this became
the business of his life. He had an intense antipathy to
Blackstone, under whom he had sat at Oxford; and in 1776 he
published anonymously a severe criticism of his work, under the
title 'Fragments on Government, or a Commentary on the
Commentaries,' which was at first attributed to Lord Mansfield,
Lord Camden, and others. His identification as the author of the
'Fragments' brought him into relations with Lord Shelburne, who
invited him to Bowood, where he made a long and happy visit, of
which bright and gossipy letters tell the story. Here he worked on
his 'Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,' in
which he developed his utilitarian theory, and here he fell in love
with a young lady who failed to respond to his wishes. Writing in
1827, he says:--</p>
<blockquote>"I am alive, more than two months advanced in my
eightieth year, more lively than when you presented me in ceremony
with a flower in Green Lane. Since that day not a single one has
passed, not to speak of nights, in which you have not engrossed
more of my thoughts than I could have wished.... Embrace----;
though it is for me, as it is by you, she will not be severe, nor
refuse her lips to me as she did her hand, at a time perhaps not
yet forgotten by her, any more than by me."</blockquote>
<p>Bentham wrote voluminously on morals, on rewards and
punishments, on the poor laws, on education, on law reform, on the
codification of laws, on special legislative measures, on a vast
variety of subjects. His style, at first simple and direct, became
turgid, involved, and obscure. He was in the habit of beginning the
same work independently many times, and usually drove several
horses abreast. He was very severe in his strictures upon persons
in authority, and upon current notions; and was constantly being
warned that if he should publish such or such a work he would
surely be prosecuted. Numerous books were therefore not published
until many years after they were written. His literary style became
so prolix and unintelligible that his disciples--Dumont, Mill, and
others--came to his rescue, and disentangled and prepared for the
press his innumerable pamphlets, full of suggestiveness and teeming
with projects of reform more or less completely realized since. His
publications include more than seventy titles, and he left a vast
accumulation of manuscript, much of which has never been read.</p>
<p>He had a wide circle of acquaintances, by whom he was held in
high honor, and his correspondence with the leading men of his time
was constant and important. In his later years he was a pugnacious
writer, but he was on intimate and jovial terms with his friends.
In 1814 he removed to Ford Abbey, near Chard, and there wrote
'Chrestomathea,' a collection of papers on the principles of
education, in which he laid stress upon the value of instruction in
science, as against the excessive predominance of Greek and Latin.
In 1823, in conjunction with James Mill and others, he established
the Westminster Review, but he did not himself contribute largely
to it. He continued, however, to the end of his life to write on
his favorite topics.</p>
<p>Robert Dale Owen, in his autobiography, gives the following
description of a visit to Bentham during the philosopher's later
years:--</p>
<blockquote>"I preserve a most agreeable recollection of that grand
old face, beaming with benignity and intelligence, and occasionally
with a touch of humor which I did not expect.... I do not remember
to have met any one of his age [seventy-eight] who seemed to have
more complete possession of his faculties, bodily and mental; and
this surprised me the more because I knew that in his childhood he
had been a feeble-limbed, frail boy.... I found him, having
overpassed by nearly a decade the allotted threescore years and
ten, with step as active and eye as bright and conversation as
vivacious as one expects in a hale man of fifty....<br>
<br>
"I shall never forget my surprise when we were ushered by the
venerable philosopher into his dining-room. An apartment of good
size, it was occupied by a platform about two feet high, and which
filled the whole room, except a passageway some three or four feet
wide, which had been left so that one could pass all round it. Upon
this platform stood the dinner-table and chairs, with room enough
for the servants to wait upon us. Around the head of the table was
a huge screen, to protect the old man, I suppose, against the
draught from the doors....<br>
<br>
"When another half-hour had passed, he touched the bell again. This
time his order to the servant startled me:--<br>
<br>
"'John, my night-cap!'<br>
<br>
"I rose to go, and one or two others did the same; Neal sat still.
'Ah!' said Bentham, as he drew a black silk night-cap over his
spare gray hair, 'you think that's a hint to go. Not a bit of it.
Sit down! I'll tell you when I am tired. I'm going to
<i>vibrate</i> a little; that assists digestion, too.'<br>
<br>
"And with that he descended into the trench-like passage, of which
I have spoken, and commenced walking briskly back and forth, his
head nearly on a level with ours, as we sat. Of course we all
turned toward him. For full half an hour, as he walked, did he
continue to pour forth such a witty and eloquent invective against
kings, priests, and their retainers, as I have seldom listened to.
Then he returned to the head of the table and kept up the
conversation, without flagging, till midnight ere he dismissed
us.<br>
<br>
"His parting words to me were characteristic:--'God bless you,--if
there be such a being; and at all events, my young friend, take
care of yourself.'"</blockquote>
<p>His weak childhood had been followed by a healthy and robust old
age. But he wore out at last, and died June 6, 1832,
characteristically leaving his body to be dissected for the benefit
of science. The greater part of his published writings were
collected by Sir John Browning, his executor, and issued in nine
large volumes in 1843.</p>

<center><b>OF THE PRINCIPLE OF UTILITY</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
Legislation'</center>
<br>
<p>Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign
masters, <i>pain</i> and <i>pleasure</i>. It is for them alone to
point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we
shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the
other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their
throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we
think; every effort we can make to throw off our subjection will
serve but to demonstrate and confirm it. In words a man may pretend
to abjure their empire; but in reality he will remain subject to it
all the while. The <i>principle of utility</i> recognizes this
subjection, and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the
object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of
reason and of law. Systems which attempt to question it deal in
sounds instead of sense, in caprice instead of reason, in darkness
instead of light.</p>
<p>But enough of metaphor and declamation: it is not by such means
that moral science is to be improved.</p>
<p>The principle of utility is the foundation of the present work;
it will be proper, therefore, at the outset to give an explicit and
determinate account of what is meant by it. By the principle of
utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of
every action whatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears
to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose
interest is in question; or, what is the same thing in other words,
to promote or to oppose that happiness. I say of every action
whatsoever; and therefore not only of every action of a private
individual, but of every measure of government.</p>
<p>By utility is meant that property in any object whereby it tends
to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness (all
this in the present case comes to the same thing), or (what comes
again to the same thing) to prevent the happening of mischief,
pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party whose interest is
considered: if that party be the community in general, then the
happiness of the community; if a particular individual, then the
happiness of that individual.</p>
<p>The interest of the community is one of the most general
expressions that can occur in the phraseology of morals: no wonder
that the meaning of it is often lost. When it has a meaning, it is
this: The community is a fictitious <i>body</i>, composed of the
individual persons who are considered as constituting, as it were,
its <i>members</i>. The interest of the community, then, is what?
The sum of the interests of the several members who compose it.</p>
<p>It is vain to talk of the interest of the community, without
understanding what is the interest of the individual. A thing is
said to promote the interest, or to be <i>for</i> the interest, of
an individual, when it tends to add to the sum total of his
pleasures: or, what comes to the same thing, to diminish the sum
total of his pains.</p>
<p>An action, then, may be said to be conformable to the principle
of utility, or for shortness' sake to utility (meaning with respect
to the community at large), when the tendency it has to augment the
happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish
it.</p>
<p>A measure of government (which is but a particular kind of
action, performed by a particular person or persons) may be said to
be conformable to or dictated by the principle of utility, when in
like manner the tendency which it has to augment the happiness of
the community is greater than any which it has to diminish it.</p>
<p>When an action, or in particular a measure of government, is
supposed by a man to be conformable to the principle of utility, it
may be convenient for the purposes of discourse to imagine a kind
of law or dictate called a law or dictate of utility, and to speak
of the action in question as being conformable to such law or
dictate.</p>
<p>A man may be said to be a partisan of the principle of utility,
when the approbation or disapprobation he annexes to any action, or
to any measure, is determined by and proportioned to the tendency
which he conceives it to have to augment or to diminish the
happiness of the community; or in other words, to its conformity or
unconformity to the laws or dictates of utility.</p>
<p>Of an action that is conformable to the principle of utility,
one may always say either that it is one that ought to be done, or
at least that it is not one that ought not to be done. One may say
also that it is right it should be done, at least that it is not
wrong it should be done; that it is a right action, at least that
it is not a wrong action. When thus interpreted, the words
<i>ought</i>, and <i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i>, and others of that
stamp, have a meaning; when otherwise, they have none.</p>

<center><b>REMINISCENCES OF CHILDHOOD</b></center>
<br>
<p>During my visits to Barking, I used to be my grandmother's
bedfellow. The dinner hour being as early as two o'clock, she had a
regular supper, which was served up in her own sleeping-room; and
immediately after finishing it, she went to bed. Of her supper I
was not permitted to partake, nor was the privation a matter of
much regret. I had what I preferred--a portion of gooseberry pie;
hers was a scrag of mutton, boiled with parsley and butter. I do
not remember any variety.</p>
<p>My amusements consisted in building houses with old cards, and
sometimes playing at 'Beat the knave out of doors' with my
grandmother. My time of going to bed was perhaps an hour before
hers; but by way of preparation, I never failed to receive her
blessing. Previous to the ceremony, I underwent a catechetical
examination, of which one of the questions was, "Who were the
children that were saved in the fiery furnace?" Answer, "Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego." But as the examination frequently got no
farther, the word Abednego got associated in my mind with very
agreeable ideas, and it ran through my ears like "Shadrach,
Meshach, and To-bed-we-go," in a sort of pleasant confusion, which
is not yet removed. As I grew in years, I became a fit receptacle
for some of my grandmother's communications, among which the state
of her family and the days of her youth were most prominent.</p>
<p>There hung on the wall, perpetually in view, a sampler, the
produce of the industry and ingenuity of her mother or her
grandmother, of which the subject-matter was the most important of
all theologico-human incidents, the fall of man in Paradise. There
was Adam--there was Eve--and there was the serpent. In these there
was much to interest and amuse me. One thing alone puzzled me; it
was the forbidden fruit. The size was enormous. It was larger than
that species of the genus <i>Orangeum</i> which goes by the name of
"the forbidden fruit" in some of our West India settlements. Its
size was not less than that of the outer shell of a cocoanut. All
the rest of the objects were as usual in <i>plano</i>; this was in
<i>alto</i>, indeed in <i>altissimo rilievo.</i> What to make of
it, at a time when my mind was unable to distinguish fictions from
realities, I knew not. The recollection is strong in me of the
mystery it seemed to be. My grandmother promised me the sampler
after her death as a legacy, and the promise was no small
gratification; but the promise, with many other promises of jewels
and gold coins, was productive of nothing but disappointment. Her
death took place when I was at Oxford. My father went down; and
without consulting me, or giving the slightest intimation of his
intention, let the house, and sold to the tenant almost everything
that was in it. It was doing as he was wont to do, notwithstanding
his undoubted affection for me. In the same way he sold the estate
he had given to me as a provision on the occasion of his second
marriage. In the mass went some music-books which I had borrowed of
Mrs. Browne. Not long after, she desired them to be returned. I
stood before her like a defenseless culprit, conscious of my
inability to make restitution; and at the same time, such was my
state of mental weakness that I knew not what to say for apology or
defense.</p>
<p>My grandmother's mother was a matron, I was told, of high
respectability and corresponding piety; well-informed and
strong-minded. She was distinguished, however; for while other
matrons of her age and quality had seen many a ghost, she had seen
but <i>one</i>. She was in this particular on a level with the
learned lecturer, afterwards judge, the commentator Blackstone. But
she was heretical, and her belief bordered on Unitarianism. And by
the way, this subject of ghosts has been among the torments of my
life. Even now, when sixty or seventy years have passed over my
head since my boyhood received the impression which my grandmother
gave it, though my judgment is wholly free, my imagination is not
wholly so. My infirmity was not unknown to the servants. It was a
permanent source of amusement to ply me with horrible phantoms in
all imaginable shapes. Under the pagan dispensation, every object a
man could set his eyes on had been the seat of some pleasant
adventure. At Barking, in the almost solitude of which so large a
portion of my life was passed, every spot that could be made by any
means to answer the purpose was the abode of some spectre or group
of spectres. So dexterous was the invention of those who worked
upon my apprehensions, that they managed to transform a real into a
fictitious being. His name was <i>Palethorp</i>; and Palethorp, in
my vocabulary, was synonymous with hobgoblin. The origin of these
horrors was this:--</p>
<p>My father's house was a short half-mile distant from the
principal part of the town, from that part where was situated the
mansion of the lord of the manor, Sir Crisp Gascoigne. One morning
the coachman and the footman took a conjunct walk to a public-house
kept by a man of the name Palethorp; they took me with them: it was
before I was breeched. They called for a pot of beer; took each of
them a sip, and handed the pot to me. On their requisition, I took
another; and when about to depart, the amount was called for. The
two servants paid their quota, and I was called on for mine.
<i>Nemo dat quod non habet</i>--this maxim, to my no small
vexation, I was compelled to exemplify. Mr. Palethorp, the
landlord, had a visage harsh and ill-favored, and he insisted on my
discharging my debt. At this very early age, without having put in
for my share of the gifts of fortune, I found myself in the state
of an insolvent debtor. The demand harassed me so mercilessly that
I could hold out no longer: the door being open, I took to my
heels; and as the way was too plain to be missed, I ran home as
fast as they could carry me. The scene of the terrors of Mr.
Palethorp's name and visitation, in pursuit of me, was the
country-house at Barking; but neither was the town-house free from
them; for in those terrors, the servants possessed an instrument by
which it was in their power at any time to get rid of my presence.
Level with the kitchen--level with the landing-place in which the
staircase took its commencement--were the usual offices. When my
company became troublesome, a sure and continually repeated means
of exonerating themselves from it was for the footman to repair to
the adjoining subterraneous apartments, invest his shoulders with
some strong covering, and concealing his countenance, stalk in with
a hollow, menacing, and inarticulate tone. Lest that should not be
sufficient, the servants had, stuck by the fireplace, the
portraiture of a hobgoblin, to which they had given the name of
Palethorp. For some years I was in the condition of poor Dr.
Priestley, on whose bodily frame another name, too awful to be
mentioned, used to produce a sensation more than mental.</p>

<center><b>LETTER FROM BOWOOD TO GEORGE WILSON (1781)</b></center>
<br>
<center>SUNDAY, 12 o'clock.</center>
<br>
<p>Where shall I begin?--Let me see--The first place, by common
right, to the ladies. The ideas I brought with me respecting the
female part of this family are turned quite topsy-turvy, and
unfortunately they are not yet cleared up. I had expected to find
in Lady Shelburne a Lady Louisa Fitzpatrick, sister of an Earl of
Ossory, whom I remember at school; instead of her, I find a lady
who has for her sister a Miss Caroline V-----: is not this the maid
of honor, the sister to Lady G-----? the lady who was fond of Lord
C------, and of whom he was fond? and whom he quitted for an
heiress and a pair of horns? Be they who they may, the one is
loveliest of matrons, the other of virgins: they have both of them
more than I could wish of reserve, but it is a reserve of modesty
rather than of pride.</p>
<p>The quadrupeds, whom you know I love next, consist of a child of
a year old, a tiger, a spaniel formerly attached to Lady
Shelburne--at present to my Lord--besides four plebeian cats who
are taken no notice of, horses, etc., and a wild boar who is sent
off on a matrimonial expedition to the farm. The four first I have
commenced a friendship with, especially the first of all, to whom I
am body-coachman extraordinary <i>en titre d'office</i>: Henry,
(for that is his name) [the present Lord Lansdowne] for such an
animal, has the most thinking countenance I ever saw; being very
clean, I can keep him without disgust and even with pleasure,
especially after having been rewarded, as I have just now, for my
attention to him, by a pair of the sweetest smiles imaginable from
his mamma and aunt. As Providence hath ordered it, they both play
on the harpsichord and at chess. I am flattered with the hopes of
engaging with them, before long, either in war or harmony: not
to-day--because, whether you know it or not, it is Sunday; I know
it, having been paying my devotions--our church, the hall--our
minister, a sleek young parson, the curate of the parish--our
saints, a naked Mercury, an Apollo in the same dress, and a Venus
de' Medicis--our congregation, the two ladies, Captain Blankett,
and your humble servant, upon the carpet by the minister--below,
the domestics, <i>superioris et inferioris ordinis</i>. Among the
former I was concerned to see poor Mathews, the librarian, who, I
could not help thinking, had as good a title to be upon the carpet
as myself.</p>
<p>Of Lord Fitzmaurice I know nothing, but from his bust and
letters: the first bespeaks him a handsome youth, the latter an
ingenious one. He is not sixteen, and already he writes better than
his father. He is under the care of a Mr. Jervis, a dissenting
minister, who has had charge of him since he was six years old. He
has never been at any public school of education. He has now for a
considerable time been traveling about the kingdom, that he may
know something of his own country before he goes to others, and be
out of the way of adulation.</p>

<center><b>FRAGMENT OF A LETTER TO LORD LANSDOWNE
(1790)</b></center>
<br>
<p>It was using me very ill, that it was, to get upon stilts as you
did, and resolve not to be angry with me, after all the pains I had
taken to make you so. You have been angry, let me tell you, with
people as little worth it before now; and your being so niggardly
of it in my instance, may be added to the account of your
injustice. I see you go upon the old Christian principle of heaping
coals of fire upon people's heads, which is the highest refinement
upon vengeance. I see, moreover, that according to your system of
cosmogony, the difference is but accidental between the race of
kings and that of the first Baron of Lixmore: that ex-lawyers come
like other men from Adam, and ex-ministers from somebody who
started up out of the ground before him, in some more elevated part
of the country.</p>
<p>To lower these pretensions, it would be serving you right, if I
were to tell you that I was not half so angry as I appeared to be;
that, therefore, according to the countryman's rule, you have not
so much the advantage over me as you may think you have: that the
real object of what anger I really felt was rather the situation in
which I found myself than you or anybody; but that, as none but a
madman would go to quarrel with a nonentity called a situation, it
was necessary for me to look out for somebody who, somehow or
other, was connected with it.</p>

<h2>JEAN-PIERRE DE B&Eacute;RANGER</h2>
<h3>(1780-1857)</h3>
<center>BY ALC&Eacute;E FORTIER</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-b.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>&eacute;ranger, like Hugo, has commemorated the date of his
birth, but their verses are very different. Hugo's poem is lofty in
style, beginning--</p>
<blockquote>"Ce si&egrave;cle avait deux ans! Rome
rempla&ccedil;ait Sparte,<br>
D&eacute;j&agrave; Napol&eacute;on per&ccedil;ait sous
Bonaparte,<br>
Et du premier consul d&eacute;j&agrave;, par maint endroit,<br>
Le front de l'empereur brisait le masque &eacute;troit."<br>
<br>
(This century was two years old; Rome displaced Sparta,<br>
Napoleon already was visible in Bonaparte,<br>
And the narrow mask of the First Consul, in many places,<br>
Was already pierced by the forehead of the Emperor.)</blockquote>
<p>B&eacute;ranger's verses have less force, but are charming in
their simplicity:--</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dans ce Paris plein d'or et de
mis&egrave;re,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; En l'an du Christ mil sept cent
quatre-vingt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chez un tailleur, mon pauvre et vieux
grand-p&egrave;re,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moi, nouveau-n&eacute;, sachais ce qui
m'advint."<br>
<br>
(In this Paris full of gold and misery,<br>
In the year of Christ one thousand seven hundred and eighty,<br>
At the house of a tailor, my grandfather poor and old,<br>
I, a new-born child, knew what happened to me.)</blockquote>
<p>Authors of the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries are more
subjective in their writings than those of the seventeenth, whose
characters can rarely be known from their works. A glance at the
life and surroundings of B&eacute;ranger will show their influence
on his genius.</p>
<p>B&eacute;ranger's mother was abandoned by her husband shortly
after her marriage, and her child was born at the house of her
father, the old tailor referred to in the song 'The Tailor and the
Fairy.' She troubled herself little about the boy, and he was
forsaken in his childhood. B&eacute;ranger tells us that he does
not know how he learned to read. In the beginning of the year 1789
he was sent to a school in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and there,
mounted on the roof of a house, he saw the capture of the Bastille
on the 14th of July. This event made a great impression on him, and
may have laid the foundations of his republican principles. When he
was nine and a half his father sent him to one of his sisters, an
innkeeper at P&eacute;ronne, that town in the north of France
famous for the interview in 1468 between Louis XI. and Charles the
Bold, when the fox put himself in the power of the lion, as related
so vividly in 'Quentin Durward.'</p>
<p>B&eacute;ranger's aunt was very kind to him. At P&eacute;ronne
he went to a free primary school founded by Ballue de Bellenglise,
where the students governed themselves, electing their mayor, their
judges, and their justices of the peace. B&eacute;ranger was
president of a republican club of boys, and was called upon several
times to address members of the Convention who passed through
P&eacute;ronne. His aunt was an ardent republican, and he was
deeply moved by the invasion of France in 1792. He heard with
delight of the capture of Toulon in 1793 and of Bonaparte's
exploits, conceiving a great admiration for the extraordinary man
who was just beginning his military career. At the age of fifteen
B&eacute;ranger returned to Paris, where his father had established
a kind of banking house. The boy had previously followed different
trades, and had been for two years with a publishing house as a
printer's apprentice. There he learned spelling and the rules of
French prosody. He began to write verse when he was twelve or
thirteen, but he had a strange idea of prosody. In order to get
lines of the same length he wrote his words between two parallel
lines traced from the top to the bottom of the page. His system of
versification seemed to be correct when applied to the Alexandrine
verse of Racine; but when he saw the fables of La Fontaine, in
which the lines are very irregular, he began to distrust his
prosody.</p>
<br>
<a name="illus-1784.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/illus-1784.jpg"><img src=
"images/illus-1784.jpg" width="45%" alt=""></a></p>
<br>
<p>B&eacute;ranger became a skillful financier, and was very useful
to his father in his business. When the banker failed the young man
was thrown into great distress. He now had ample opportunity to
become familiar with the garret, of which he has sung so well. In
1804 he applied for help to Lucien Bonaparte, and received from
Napoleon's brother his own fee as member of the Institute. He
obtained shortly afterwards a position in a bureau of the
University. Having a weak constitution and defective sight, he
avoided the conscription. He was however all his life a true
patriot, with republican instincts; and he says that he never liked
Voltaire, because that celebrated writer unjustly preferred
foreigners and vilified Joan of Arc, "the true patriotic divinity,
who from my childhood was the object of my worship." He had
approved of the eighteenth of Brumaire: for "my soul," says he,
"has always vibrated with that of the people as when I was nineteen
years old;" and the great majority of the French people in 1799
wished to see Bonaparte assume power and govern with a firm hand.
In 1813 B&eacute;ranger wrote 'The King of Yvetot,' a pleasing and
amusing satire on Napoleon's reign. What a contrast between the
despotic emperor and ruthless warrior, and the simple king whose
crown is a nightcap and whose chief delight is his bottle of wine!
The song circulated widely in manuscript form, and the author soon
became popular. He made the acquaintance of D&eacute;saugiers and
became a member of the Caveau. Concerning this joyous literary
society M. Anatole France says, in his 'Vie Litt&eacute;raire,'
that the first Caveau was founded in 1729 by Gallet, Piron,
Cr&eacute;billon <i>fils</i>, Coll&eacute;, and Panard. They used
to meet at Laudelle the tavern-keeper's. The second Caveau was
inaugurated in 1759 by Marmontel, Suard, Lanoue, and Brissy, and
lasted until the Revolution. In 1806 Armand Gouff&eacute; and
Capelle established the modern Caveau, of which D&eacute;saugiers
was president. The members met at Balaine's restaurant. In 1834 the
society was reorganized at Champlanc's restaurant. The members
wrote and published songs and sang them after dinner. "The Caveau,"
says M. France, "is the French Academy of song," and as such has
some dignity. The same is true of the Lice, while the Chat Noir is
most <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i>.</p>
<p>To understand B&eacute;ranger's songs and to excuse them
somewhat, we must remember that the French always delighted in
witty songs and tales, and pardoned the immorality of the works on
account of the wit and humor. This is what is called <i>l'esprit
gaulois</i>, and is seen principally in old French poetry, in the
fabliaux, the farces, and 'Le Roman de Renart.' Moli&egrave;re had
much of this, as also had La Fontaine and Voltaire, and
B&eacute;ranger's wildest songs appear mild and innocent when
compared with those of the Chat Noir. In his joyous songs he
continues the traditions of the farces and fabliaux of the Middle
Ages, and in his political songs he uses wit and satire just as in
the <i>sottises</i> of the time of Louis XII.</p>
<p>B&eacute;ranger's first volume of songs appeared at the
beginning of the second Restoration; and although it was hostile to
the Bourbons, the author was not prosecuted. In 1821, when his
second volume was published, he resigned his position as clerk at
the University, and was brought to trial for having written immoral
and seditious songs. He was condemned, after exciting scenes in
court, to three months' imprisonment and a fine of five hundred
francs, and in 1828 to nine months' imprisonment and a fine of ten
thousand francs, which was paid by public subscription.</p>
<p>No doubt he contributed to the Revolution of July, 1830; but
although he was a republican, he favored the monarchy of Louis
Philippe, saying that "it was a plank to cross over the gutter, a
preparation for the republic." The king wished to see him and thank
him, but B&eacute;ranger replied that "he was too old to make new
acquaintances." He was invited to apply for a seat in the French
Academy, and refused that honor as he had refused political honors
and positions. He said that he "wished to be nothing"; and when in
1848 he was elected to the Constitutional Assembly, he resigned his
seat almost immediately. He has been accused of affectation, and of
exaggeration in his disinterestedness; but he was naturally timid
in public, and preferred to exert an influence over his countrymen
by his songs rather than by his voice in public assemblies.</p>
<p>B&eacute;ranger was kind and generous, and ever ready to help
all who applied to him. He had a pension given to Rouget de l'Isle,
the famous author of the 'Marseillaise,' who was reduced to
poverty, and in 1835 he took into his house his good aunt from
P&eacute;ronne, and gave hospitality also to his friend Mlle.
Judith Fr&egrave;re. In 1834 he sold all his works to his
publisher, Perrotin, for an annuity of eight hundred francs, which
was increased to four thousand by the publisher. On this small
income B&eacute;ranger lived content till his death on July 16th,
1857. The government of Napoleon III. took charge of his funeral,
which was solemnized with great pomp. Although B&eacute;ranger was
essentially the poet of the middle classes, and was extremely
popular, care was taken to exclude the people from the funeral
procession. While he never denied that he was the grandson of a
tailor, he signed <i>de</i> B&eacute;ranger, to be distinguished
from other writers of the same name. The <i>de</i>, however, had
always been claimed by his father, who had left him nothing but
that pretense of nobility.</p>
<p>For forty years, from 1815 to his death, B&eacute;ranger was
perhaps the most popular French writer of his time, and he was
ranked amongst the greatest French poets. There has been a reaction
against that enthusiasm, and he is now severely judged by the
critics. They say that he lacked inspiration, and was vulgar,
bombastic, and grandiloquent. Little attention is paid to him,
therefore, in general histories of French literature. But if he is
not entitled to stand on the high pedestal given to him by his
contemporaries, we yet cannot deny genius to the man who for more
than a generation swayed the hearts of the people at his will, and
exerted on his countrymen and on his epoch an immense
influence.</p>
<p>Many of his songs are coarse and even immoral; but his muse was
often inspired by patriotic subjects, and in his poems on Napoleon
he sings of the exploits of the great general defending French soil
from foreign invasion, or he delights in the victories of the
Emperor as reflecting glory upon France. Victor Hugo shared this
feeling when he wrote his inspiring verses in praise of the
conqueror. Both poets, B&eacute;ranger and Hugo, contributed to
create the Napoleonic legend which facilitated the election of
Louis Napoleon to the presidency in 1848, and brought about the
Second Empire. What is more touching than 'The Reminiscences of the
People'? Are we not inclined to cry out, like the little children
listening to the old grandmother who speaks of Napoleon: "He spoke
to you, grandmother! He sat down there, grandmother! You have yet
his glass, grandmother!" The whole song is poetic, natural, and
simple. Fran&ccedil;ois Copp&eacute;e, the great poet, said of it:
"Ah! if I had only written 'The Reminiscences of the People,' I
should not feel concerned about the judgment of posterity."</p>
<p>Other works of B&eacute;ranger's are on serious subjects, as
'Mary Stuart's Farewell to France,' 'The Holy Alliance,' 'The
Swallows,' and 'The Old Banner,' All his songs have a charm. His
wit is not of the highest order, and he lacks the <i>finesse</i> of
La Fontaine, but he is often quaint and always amusing in his songs
devoted to love and Lisette, to youth and to wine. He is not one of
the greatest French lyric poets, and cannot be compared with
Lamartine, Hugo, Musset, and Vigny; nevertheless he has much
originality, and is without doubt the greatest song-writer that
France has produced. He elevated the song and made it both a poem
and a drama, full of action and interest.</p>
<p>B&eacute;ranger wrote slowly and with great care, and many of
his songs cost him much labor. He was filled with compassion for
the weak, for the poor and unfortunate; he loved humanity, and
above all he dearly loved France. Posterity will do him justice and
will preserve at least a great part of his work. M. Ernest
Legouv&eacute; in his interesting work, 'La Lecture en Action,'
relates that one day, while walking with B&eacute;ranger in the
Bois de Boulogne, the latter stopped in the middle of an alley, and
taking hold of M. Legouv&eacute;'s hand, said with emotion, "My
dear friend, my ambition would be that one hundred of my lines
should remain." M. Legouv&eacute; adds, "There will remain more
than that," and his words have been confirmed. If we read aloud, if
we sing them, we too shall share the enthusiasm of our fathers, who
were carried away by the pathos, the grandeur, the wit, the
inexpressible charm of the unrivaled <i>chansonnier</i>.</p>

'Tis some god. Yes, I have a suspicion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our happiness jealous, he's come:<br>
Let us drive him away to perdition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he bore us no more with his hum.<br>

Transformed to a gad-fly unseemly,<br>

Old Reason, the grumbler, extremely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Annoyed by our joy and our cheer.<br>
He tells us in tones of monition<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the clouds and the tempests to come:<br>
Let us drive him away to perdition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he bore us no more with his hum.<br>
<br>
It is Reason who comes to me, quaffing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And says, "It is time to retire:<br>
At your age one stops drinking and laughing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stops loving, nor sings with such fire;"--<br>
An alarm that sounds ever its mission<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sweetest of flames overcome:<br>
Let us drive him away to perdition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he bore us no more with his hum.<br>
<br>
It is Reason! Look out there for Lizzie!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His dart is a menace alway.<br>
He has touched her, she swoons--she is dizzy:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, Cupid, and drive him away.<br>
Pursue him; compel his submission,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until under your strokes he succumb.<br>
Let us drive him away to perdition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he bore us no more with his hum.<br>
<br>
Hurrah, Victory! See, he is drowning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wine that Lizzetta has poured.<br>
Come, the head of Joy let us be crowning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That again he may reign at our board.<br>
He was threatened just now with dismission,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a fly made us all rather glum:<br>
But we've sent him away to perdition;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He will bore us no more with his hum.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not harshly to constrain;<br>
And since excess makes pleasure less,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, so much more refrain.<br>
Small table--cozy corner--here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We well may be beguiled;<br>
Our worthy host old wine can boast:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink, drink--but draw it mild!<br>
<br>
He who would many an evil shun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will find my plan the best--<br>
To trim the sail as shifts the gale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And half-seas over rest.<br>
Enjoyment is an art--disgust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is bred of joy run wild;<br>
Too deep a drain upsets the brain:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink, drink--but draw it mild!<br>
<br>
Our indigence--let's cheer it up;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis nonsense to repine;<br>
To give to Hope the fullest scope<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Needs but one draught of wine.<br>
And oh! be temperate, to enjoy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye on whom Fate hath smiled;<br>
If deep the bowl, your thirst control:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink, drink--but draw it mild!<br>
<br>
What, Phyllis, dost thou fear? at this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My lesson dost thou scoff?<br>
Or would'st thou say, light draughts betray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The toper falling off?<br>
Keen taste, eyes keen--whate'er be seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of joy in thine, fair child,<br>
Love's philtre use, but don't abuse:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink, drink--but draw it mild!<br>
<br>
Yes, without hurrying, let us roam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From feast to feast of gladness;<br>
And reach old age, if not quite sage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With method in our madness!<br>
Our health is sound, good wines abound;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends, these are riches piled.<br>
To use with thrift the twofold gift:<br>

<blockquote><b>THE KING OF YVETOT</b><br>
<br>
There was a king of Yvetot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of whom renown hath little
said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who let all thoughts of glory go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dawdled half his days a-bed;<br>
And every night, as night came round,<br>
By Jenny with a nightcap crowned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slept very
sound:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing ho, ho, ho! and he, he,
he!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the kind of king for
me.<br>
<br>
And every day it came to pass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That four lusty meals made he;<br>
And step by step, upon an ass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode abroad, his realms to see;<br>
And wherever he did stir,<br>
What think you was his escort, sir?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, an old
cur.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing ho, ho, ho! and he, he,
he!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the kind of king for
me.<br>
<br>
If e'er he went into excess,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas from a somewhat lively thirst;<br>
But he who would his subjects bless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Odd's fish!--must wet his whistle first;<br>
And so from every cask they got,<br>
Our king did to himself allot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least a pot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing ho, ho, ho! and he, he,
he!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the kind of king for
me.<br>
<br>
To all the ladies of the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A courteous king, and kind, was he--<br>
The reason why, you'll understand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They named him Pater Patriae.<br>
Each year he called his fighting men,<br>
And marched a league from home, and then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marched back
again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing ho, ho, ho! and he, he,
he!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the kind of king for
me.<br>
<br>
Neither by force nor false pretense,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He sought to make his kingdom great,<br>
And made (O princes, learn from hence)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Live and let live" his rule of state.<br>
'Twas only when he came to die,<br>
That his people who stood by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were known to
cry.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing ho, ho, ho! and he, he,
he!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the kind of king for
me.<br>
<br>
The portrait of this best of kings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is extant still, upon a sign<br>
That on a village tavern swings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Famed in the country for good wine.<br>
The people in their Sunday trim,<br>
Filling their glasses to the brim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up to him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing "ha, ha, ha!" and "he,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, I want no pity--none.<br>

One jolly evening, when my friends and I<br>

<center><b>FROM HIS PREFACE TO HIS COLLECTED POEMS</b></center>
<br>
<p>I have treated it [the revolution of 1830] as a power which
might have whims one should be in a position to resist. All or
nearly all my friends have taken office. I have still one or two
who are hanging from the greased pole. I am pleased to believe that
they are caught by the coat-tails, in spite of their efforts to
come down. I might therefore have had a share in the distribution
of offices. Unluckily I have no love for sinecures, and all
compulsory labor has grown intolerable to me, except perhaps that
of a copying clerk. Slanderers have pretended that I acted from
virtue. Pshaw! I acted from laziness. That defect has served me in
place of merits; wherefore I recommend it to many of our honest
men. It exposes one, however, to curious reproaches. It is to that
placid indolence that severe critics have laid the distance I have
kept myself from those of my honorable friends who have attained
power. Giving too much honor to what they choose to call my fine
intellect, and forgetting too much how far it is from simple good
sense to the science of great affairs, these critics maintain that
my counsels might have enlightened more than one minister. If one
believes them, I, crouching behind our statesmen's velvet chairs,
would have conjured down the winds, dispelled the storms, and
enabled France to swim in an ocean of delights. We should all have
had liberty to sell, or rather to give away, but we are still
rather ignorant of the price. Ah! my two or three friends who take
a song-writer for a magician, have you never heard, then, that
power is a bell which prevents those who set it ringing from
hearing anything else? Doubtless ministers sometimes consult those
at hand: consultation is a means of talking about one's self which
is rarely neglected. But it will not be enough even to consult in
good faith those who will advise in the same way. One must still
act: that is the duty of the position. The purest intentions, the
most enlightened patriotism, do not always confer it. Who has not
seen high officials leave a counselor with brave intentions, and an
instant after return to him, from I know not what fascination, with
a perplexity that gave the lie to the wisest resolutions? "Oh!"
they say, "we will not be caught there again! what drudgery!" The
more shamefaced add, "I'd like to see you in my place!" When a
minister says that, be sure he has no longer a head. There is
indeed one of them, but only one, who, without having lost his
head, has often used this phrase with the utmost sincerity; he has
therefore never used it to a friend.</p>

<h2>GEORGE BERKELEY</h2>

<p>ew readers in the United States are unfamiliar with the lines,
"Westward the course of empire takes its way." It is vaguely
remembered that a certain Bishop Berkeley was the author of a
treatise on tar-water. There is moreover a general impression that
this Bishop Berkeley contended for the unreality of all things
outside of his own mind, and now and then some recall Byron's
lines--</p>
<blockquote>"When Bishop Berkeley said 'there was no matter,'<br>
And proved it,--'twas no matter what he said."</blockquote>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-377.png" width="45%" alt=

<b>George Berkeley.</b></p>
<p>This is the substance of the popular knowledge of one of the
profoundest thinkers of the early part of the eighteenth
century,--the time of Shaftesbury and Locke, of Addison and Steele,
of Butler, Pope, and Swift,--one of the most fascinating men of his
day, and one of the best of any age. Beside, or rather above,
Byron's line should be placed Pope's tribute:--</p>
<blockquote>"To Berkeley, every virtue under Heaven."</blockquote>
<p>Berkeley was born in Ireland, probably at Dysart Castle in the
Valley of the Nore, near Kilkenny, March 12, 1685. The family
having but lately come into Ireland, Berkeley always accounted
himself an Englishman. At Kilkenny School he met the poet Prior,
who became his intimate friend, his business representative, and
his most regular correspondent for life. Swift preceded him at this
school and at Trinity College, Dublin, whither Berkeley went March
21, 1700, being then fifteen years of age. Here as at Kilkenny he
took rank much beyond his years, and was soon deep in philosophical
speculations.</p>
<p>In Professor Fraser's edition of the 'Life and Works of
Berkeley' appears a 'Common-Place Book,' kept during the Trinity
College terms, and full of most remarkable memoranda for a youth of
his years. In 1709, while still at Trinity, he published an 'Essay
toward a New Theory of Vision,' which foreshadowed imperfectly his
leading ideas. In the following year he published a 'Treatise
concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge.' Two or three years
later he went to London, where he was received with unusual favor
and quickly became intimate in the literary circles of the day. He
made friends everywhere, being attractive in all ways, young,
handsome, graceful, fascinating in discourse, enthusiastic, and
full of thought. Swift was especially impressed by him, and did
much to further his fortunes.</p>
<p>His philosophical conceptions he at this time popularized in
'Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous,' a work rated by some
critics as at the head of its class.</p>
<p>Before going to London, Berkeley had been made a Fellow of
Trinity, had been appointed to various college offices, and had
taken orders. He remained away from Dublin for about eight years,
on leave frequently extended, writing in London, and traveling,
teaching, and writing on the Continent. On his return from his
foreign travels in 1720 or 1721, he found society completely
demoralized by the collapse of the South Sea bubble. He was much
depressed by the conditions around him, and sought to awaken the
moral sense of the people by 'An Essay toward Preventing the Ruin
of Great Britain.' Returning to Dublin and resuming college duties,
he was shortly made Dean of Dromore, and then Dean of Derry. Hardly
had he received these dignified appointments when he began planning
to rid himself of them, being completely absorbed in a scheme for a
University in the Bermudas, which should educate scholars,
teachers, and ministers for the New World, to which his hope
turned. To this scheme he devoted himself for many years. A
singular occurrence, which released him from pecuniary cares,
enabled him to give his time as well as his heart to the work. Miss
Vanhomrigh, the 'Vanessa' of Swift, upon her mother's death, left
London, and went to live in Ireland, to be near her beloved Dean;
and there she was informed of Swift's marriage to 'Stella.' The
news killed her, but she revoked the will by which her fortune was
bequeathed to Swift, and left one-half of it, or about
&pound;4,000, to Berkeley, whom she had met but once. He must have
"kept an atmosphere," as Bagehot says of Francis Horner.</p>
<p>Going to London on fire with his great scheme, prepared to
resign his deanery and cast in his lot with that of the proposed
University, Berkeley wasted years in the effort to secure a charter
and grant from the administration. His enthusiasm and his
fascinating manners effected much, and over and over again only the
simplest formalities seemed necessary to success. Only the will of
Sir Robert Walpole stood in the way, but Walpole's will sufficed.
At last, in September, 1728, tired of waiting at court, Berkeley,
who had just married, sailed with three or four friends, including
the artist Smibert, for Rhode Island, intending to await there the
completion of his grant, and then proceed to Bermuda. He bought a
farm near Newport, and built a house which he called Whitehall, in
which he lived for about three years, leaving a tradition of a
benignant but retired and scholastic life. Among the friends who
were here drawn to him was the Rev. Samuel Johnson of Stratford,
afterward the first President of King's (now Columbia) College,
with whom he corresponded during the remainder of his life, and
through whom he was able to aid greatly the cause of education in
America.</p>
<p>The Newport life was idyllic. Berkeley wrote home that the
winters were cooler than those of the South of Ireland, but not
worse than he had known in Italy. He brought over a good library,
and read and wrote. The principal work of this period, written in a
romantic cleft in the rocks, was 'Alciphron, or the Minute
Philosopher,' in seven dialogues, directed especially against
atheism.</p>
<p>At length, through Lord Percival, Berkeley learned that Walpole
would not allow the parliamentary grant of, &pound;20,000 for the
Bermuda College, and returned to England at the close of 1732. His
Whitehall estate he conveyed to Yale College for the maintenance of
certain scholarships. From England he sent over nearly a thousand
volumes for the Yale library, the best collection of books ever
brought at one time to America, being helped in the undertaking by
some of the Bermuda subscribers. A little later he sent a
collection of books to Harvard College also, and presented a
valuable organ to Trinity Church in Newport.</p>
<p>Shortly after his return, Berkeley was appointed Bishop of
Cloyne, near Cork in Ireland, and here he remained for about
eighteen years. Although a recluse, he wrote much, and he kept up
his loving relations with old friends who still survived. He had
several children to educate, and he cultivated music and painting.
He attempted to establish manufactures, and to cultivate habits of
industry and refinement among the people. The winter of 1739 was
bitterly cold. This was followed by general want, famine, and
disease. Berkeley and his family lived simply and gave away what
they could save. Large numbers of the people died from an epidemic.
In America Berkeley's attention had been drawn to the medicinal
virtues of tar, and he experimented successfully with tar-water as
a remedy. Becoming more and more convinced of its value, he
exploited his supposed discovery with his usual ardor, writing
letters and essays, and at length 'A Chain of Philosophical
Reflections and Enquiries concerning the Virtues of Tar-water and
divers other subjects connected together and arising one from
another.' This was called 'Siris' in a second edition which was
soon demanded. Beginning with the use of tar-water as a remedy, the
treatise gradually developed into the treatment of the largest
themes, and offered the ripest fruits of the Bishop's
philosophy.</p>
<p>Berkeley's system was neither consistent nor complete, but much
of it remains sound. In brief, he contended that matter has no
independent existence, but is an idea in the supreme mind, which is
realized in various forms by the human mind. Without mind nothing
exists. Cause cannot exist except as it rests in mind and will. All
so-called physical causes are merely cases of constant sequence of
phenomena. Far from denying the reality of phenomena, Berkeley
insists upon it; but contends that reality depends upon the
supremacy of mind. Abstract matter does not and cannot exist. The
mind can only perceive qualities of objects, and infers the
existence of the objects from them; or as a modern writer tersely
puts it, "The only thing certain is mind. Matter is a doubtful and
uncertain inference of the human intellect."</p>
<p>The essay upon Tar-water attracted great attention. The good
bishop wrote much also for periodicals, mainly upon practical
themes; and in The Querist, an intermittent journal, considered
many matters of ethical and political importance to the country.
Though a bishop of the Established Church, he lived upon the most
friendly terms with his Roman Catholic neighbors, and his labors
were highly appreciated by them.</p>
<p>But his life was waning. His friends had passed away, he had
lost several children, his health was broken. He desired to retire
to Oxford and spend the remainder of his life in scholarly
seclusion. He asked to exchange his bishopric for a canonry, but
this could not be permitted. He then begged to be allowed to resign
his charge, but the king replied that he might live where he
pleased, but that he should die a bishop in spite of himself. In
August, 1752, Bishop Berkeley removed himself, his wife, his
daughter, and his goods to Oxford, where his son George was a
student; and here on the fourteenth of the following January, as he
was resting on his couch by the fireside at tea-time, his busy
brain stopped thinking, and his kind heart ceased to beat.</p>

<center><b>ESSAY ON TAR-WATER</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Siris'</center>
<br>
<p>The seeds of things seem to lie latent in the air, ready to
appear and produce their kind, whenever they light on a proper
matrix. The extremely small seeds of fern, mosses, mushrooms, and
some other plants, are concealed and wafted about in the air, every
part whereof seems replete with seeds of one kind or other. The
whole atmosphere seems alive. There is everywhere acid to corrode,
and seed to engender. Iron will rust, and mold will grow, in all
places. Virgin earth becomes fertile, crops of new plants ever and
anon show themselves, all which demonstrate the air to be a common
seminary and receptacle of all vivifying principles....</p>
<p>The eye by long use comes to see, even in the darkest cavern;
and there is no subject so obscure, but we may discern some glimpse
of truth by long poring on it. Truth is the cry of all, but the
game of a few. Certainly where it is the chief passion, it doth not
give way to vulgar cares and views; nor is it contented with a
little ardor in the early time of life; active, perhaps, to pursue,
but not so fit to weigh and revise. He that would make a real
progress in knowledge, must dedicate his age as well as youth, the
later growth as well as first fruits, at the altar of truth....</p>
<p>As the nerves are instruments of sensation, it follows that
spasms in the nerves may produce all symptoms, and therefore a
disorder in the nervous system shall imitate all distempers, and
occasion, in appearance, an asthma for instance, a pleurisy, or a
fit of the stone. Now, whatever is good for the nerves in general
is good against all such symptoms. But tar-water, as it includes in
an eminent degree the virtues of warm gums and resins, is of great
use for comforting and strengthening the nerves, curing twitches in
the nervous fibres, cramps also, and numbness in the limbs,
removing anxieties and promoting sleep, in all which cases I have
known it very successful.</p>
<p>This safe and cheap medicine suits all circumstances and all
constitutions, operating easily, curing without disturbing, raising
the spirits without depressing them, a circumstance that deserves
repeated attention, especially in these climates, where strong
liquors so fatally and so frequently produce those very distresses
they are designed to remedy; and if I am not misinformed, even
among the ladies themselves, who are truly much to be pitied. Their
condition of life makes them a prey to imaginary woes, which never
fail to grow up in minds unexercised and unemployed. To get rid of
these, it is said, there are who betake themselves to distilled
spirits. And it is not improbable they are led gradually to the use
of those poisons by a certain complaisant pharmacy, too much used
in the modern practice, palsy drops, poppy cordial, plague water,
and such-like, which being in truth nothing but drams disguised,
yet coming from the apothecaries, are considered only as
medicines.</p>
<p>The soul of man was supposed by many ancient sages to be thrust
into the human body as into a prison, for punishment of past
offenses. But the worst prison is the body of an indolent epicure,
whose blood is inflamed by fermented liquors and high sauces, or
rendered putrid, sharp, and corrosive by a stagnation of the animal
juices through sloth and indolence; whose membranes are irritated
by pungent salts; whose mind is agitated by painful oscillations of
the nervous system, and whose nerves are mutually affected by the
irregular passions of his mind. This ferment in the animal economy
darkens and confounds the intellect. It produceth vain terrors and
vain conceits, and stimulates the soul with mad desires, which, not
being natural, nothing in nature can satisfy. No wonder, therefore,
there are so many fine persons of both sexes, shining themselves,
and shone on by fortune, who are inwardly miserable and sick of
life.</p>
<p>The hardness of stubbed vulgar constitutions renders them
insensible of a thousand things that fret and gall those delicate
people, who, as if their skin was peeled off, feel to the quick
everything that touches them. The remedy for this exquisite and
painful sensibility is commonly sought from fermented, perhaps from
distilled liquors, which render many lives wretched that would
otherwise have been only ridiculous. The tender nerves and low
spirits of such poor creatures would be much relieved by the use of
tar-water, which might prolong and cheer their lives. I do
therefore recommend to them the use of a cordial, not only safe and
innocent, but giving health and spirit as sure as other cordials
destroy them.</p>
<p>I do verily think there is not any other medicine whatsoever so
effectual to restore a crazy constitution and cheer a dreary mind,
or so likely to subvert that gloomy empire of the spleen which
tyrannizeth over the better sort (as they are called) of these free
nations, and maketh them, in spite of their liberty and property,
more wretched slaves than even the subjects of absolute power who
breathe clear air in a sunny climate, while men of low degree often
enjoy a tranquillity and content that no advantage of birth or
fortune can equal. Such indeed was the case while the rich alone
could afford to be debauched; but when even beggars became
debauchees, the case was altered.</p>
<p>The public virtue and spirit of the British legislature never
showed itself more conspicuous in any act, than in that for
suppressing the immoderate use of distilled spirits among the
people, whose strength and numbers constitute the true wealth of a
nation: though evasive arts will, it is feared, prevail so long as
distilled spirits of any kind are allowed, the character of
Englishmen in general being that of Brutus, <i>Quicquid vult valde
vult</i> [whatever he desires he desires intensely]. But why should
such a canker be tolerated in the vitals of a State, under any
pretense, or in any shape whatsoever? Better by far the whole
present set of distillers were pensioners of the public, and their
trade abolished by law; since all the benefit thereof put together
would not balance the hundredth part of its mischief.</p>
<p>This tar-water will also give charitable relief to the ladies,
who often want it more than the parish poor; being many of them
never able to make a good meal, and sitting pale and puny, and
forbidden like ghosts, at their own table, victims of vapors and
indigestion.</p>
<p>Studious persons also, pent up in narrow holes, breathing bad
air, and stooping over their books, are much to be pitied. As they
are debarred the free use of air and exercise, this I will venture
to recommend as the best succedaneum to both; though it were to be
wished that modern scholars would, like the ancients, meditate and
converse more in walks and gardens and open air, which upon the
whole would perhaps be no hindrance to their learning, and a great
advantage to their health. My own sedentary course of life had long
since thrown me into an ill habit, attended with many ailments,
particularly a nervous colic, which rendered my life a burden, and
the more so because my pains were exasperated by exercise. But
since the use of tar-water, I find, though not a perfect recovery
from my old and rooted illness, yet such a gradual return of health
and ease, that I esteem my having taken this medicine the greatest
of all temporal blessings, and am convinced that under Providence I
owe my life to it.</p>

<h2>HECTOR BERLIOZ</h2>
<h3>(1803-1869)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>o the concert-goer the name Hector Berlioz calls up a series of
vast and magnificent whirlwinds of vocal and orchestral sonority,
the thoughts of scores that sound and look imposingly complex to
the eyes and ears of both the educated and uneducated in the
composer's art. We have a vision of close pages embodying the most
unequivocal and drastic of musical "realism." The full audacity and
mastery of a certain sort of genius are represented in his vast
works. They bespeak, too, the combative musician and reformer.
Berlioz took the kingdom of music by violence.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-385.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Hector Berlioz.</b></p>
<p>His <i>chef d'oeuvres</i> do not all say to us as much as he
meant them to say, not as much as they all uttered twenty years
ago. There is much clay as well as gold in them. But such
tremendous products of his energy and intellect as the 'Requiem,'
the 'Te Deum,' 'The Damnation of Faust,' his best descriptive
symphonies such as the 'Romeo and Juliet,' are yet eloquent to the
public and to the critical-minded. His best was so very good that
his worst--weighed as a matter of principle or execution, regarded
as music or "programme music"--can be excused.</p>
<p>Berlioz's actual biography is a long tale of storm and stress.
Not only was he slow in gaining appreciation while he lived; full
comprehension of his power was not granted him till after his
energetic life was over. Recognition in his own country is
incomplete to day. He was born in 1803, near picturesque Grenoble,
in the little town of C&ocirc;te St. Andr&eacute;, the son of an
excellent country doctor. Sent to Paris to study medicine, he
became a musician against his father's wish, and in lieu of the
allowance that his father promptly withdrew, the young man lived by
engaging in the chorus of the Gymnase, and by catching at every
straw for subsistence. He became a regular music-student of the
Conservatory, under the admirable Lesueur and Reicha; quitted the
Conservatory in disgust at its pedantry, in 1825; and lived and
advanced in musical study as best he could for a considerable time.
His convictions in art were founded largely on the rock of Gluck,
Mozart, Beethoven, and Weber; and however modern, and however
widely his work departs from such academic models, Berlioz never
forswore a certain allegiance to these great and serene masters. He
returned to the Conservatory, studied hard, gained the Prix de
Rome, gradually took a prominent place among Parisian composers,
and was as enthusiastically the subject of a cult as was Wagner.
His concerts and the production of his operas encountered shameful
cabals. His strongest works were neglected or ill-served. To their
honor, German musicians understood him, Schumann and Liszt in
especial. Only in Germany to-day are his colossal operas heard. The
Italian Paganini showed a generous interest in his struggles.
Russia and Austria too admired him, while his compatriots hissed.
His career was one of endless work, disappointments, brief
successes, battles, hopes, and despairs. Personally, too, it was
full of the happiness and unhappiness of the artistic
temperament.</p>
<p>It was between the two periods of his Conservatory life that he
endured his chief sentimental misfortune,--his falling in love with
and finally marrying Henrietta Smithson. Miss Smithson was a young
English actress playing Shakespearean roles in France with a
passing success. She was exquisitely lovely--Delaroche has painted
her spirituelle beauty in his 'Ophelia.' The marriage was the
typically unfortunate artist-match; and she became a paralytic
invalid for years. After her death, tours in Germany and elsewhere,
new works, new troubles, enthusiasms, and disappointments filled up
the remainder of the composer's days. He returned to his beloved
Dauphin&eacute;, war-worn and almost as one who has outlived life.
In his provincial retreat he composed the huge operatic duology
'The Trojans at Carthage,' and 'The Taking of Troy,' turning once
more to Virgil, his early literary love. Neither of them is often
heard now, any more than his amazing 'Benvenuto Cellini.' Their
author died in Dauphin&eacute; in 1869, weary, disenchanted, but
conscious that he would be greater in the eyes of a coming
generation than ever he had been during his harassed life.</p>
<p>Berlioz's literary remains are valuable as criticisms, and their
personal matter is of brisk and varied charm. His intense feeling
for Shakespeare influenced his whole &aelig;sthetic life. He was
extremely well read. His most unchecked tendency to romanticism was
balanced by a fine feeling for the classics. He loved the greater
Greek and Latin writers. His Autobiography is a perfect picture of
himself emotionally, and exhibits his wide &aelig;sthetic nature.
His Letters are equally faithful as portraiture. He possessed a
distinctively literary style. He tells us how he fell in
love--twice, thrice; records the disgraceful cabals and intrigues
against his professional success, and explains how a landscape
affected his nerves. He is excellent reading, apparently without
taking much pains to be so. Vivacity, wit, sincerity, are salient
traits. In his volume of musical essays entitled 'A Travers Chants'
(an untranslatable title which may be paraphrased 'Memoirs of Music
and Musicians') are superior appreciations of musicians and
interpreters and performances in opera-house and concert-hall,
expressed with grace and taste in the <i>feuilletonist's</i> best
manner. In the Journal des D&eacute;bats, year by year, he wrote
himself down indisputably among the great French critics; and he
never misused his critical post to make it a lever for his own
advantage. His great treatise on Orchestration is a standard work
not displaced by Gevaert or more recent authorities. He was not
only a musical intelligence of enormous capacity: he offers perhaps
as typical an embodiment of the French artistic temperament as can
be pointed out.</p>
<br>
<a name="BERLIOZ_01"></a>
<center><b>THE ITALIAN RACE AS MUSICIANS AND AUDITORS</b></center>
<br>
<center>From Berlioz's Autobiography</center>
<br>
<p>It appears, however,--so at least I am assured,--that the
Italians do occasionally listen. But at any rate, music to the
Milanese, no less than to the Neapolitans, Romans, Florentines, and
Genoese, means nothing but an air, a duet, or a trio, well sung.
For anything beyond this they feel simply aversion or indifference.
Perhaps these antipathies are mainly due to the wretched
performance of their choruses and orchestras, which effectually
prevents their knowing anything good outside the beaten track they
have so long followed. Possibly, too, they may to a certain extent
understand the flights of men of genius, if these latter are
careful not to give too rude a shock to their rooted predilections.
The great success of 'Guillaume Tell' at Florence supports this
opinion, and even Spontini's sublime 'Vestale' obtained a series of
brilliant representations at Naples some twenty-five years ago.
Moreover, in those towns which are under the Austrian rule, you
will see the people rush after a military band, and listen with
avidity to the beautiful German melodies, so unlike their usual
insipid cavatinas. Nevertheless, in general it is impossible to
disguise the fact that the Italians as a nation really appreciate
only the material effects of music, and distinguish nothing but its
exterior forms.</p>
<p>Indeed, I am much inclined to regard them as more inaccessible
to the poetical side of art, and to any conceptions at all above
the common, than any other European nation. To the Italians music
is a sensual pleasure, and nothing more. For this most beautiful
form of expression they have scarcely more respect than for the
culinary art. In fact, they like music which they can take in at
first hearing, without reflection or attention, just as they would
do with a plate of macaroni.</p>
<p>Now, we French, mean and contemptible musicians as we are,
although we are no better than the Italians when we furiously
applaud a trill or a chromatic scale by the last new singer, and
miss altogether the beauty of some grand recitative or animated
chorus, yet at least we can listen, and if we do not take in a
composer's ideas it is not our fault. Beyond the Alps, on the
contrary, people behave in a manner so humiliating both to art and
to artists, whenever any representation is going on, that I confess
I would as soon sell pepper and spice at a grocer's in the Rue St.
Denis as write an opera for the Italians--nay, I would
<i>sooner</i> do it.</p>
<p>Added to this, they are slaves to routine and to fanaticism to a
degree one hardly sees nowadays, even at the Academy. The slightest
unforeseen innovation, whether in melody, harmony, rhythm, or
instrumentation, puts them into a perfect fury; so much so, that
the <i>dilettanti</i> of Rome, on the appearance of Rossini's
'Barbiere di Seviglia' (which is Italian enough in all conscience),
were ready to kill the young maestro for having the insolence to do
anything unlike Paisiello.</p>
<p>But what renders all hope of improvement quite chimerical, and
tempts one to believe that the musical feeling of the Italians is a
mere necessary result of their organization,--the opinion both of
Gall and Spurzheim,--is their love for all that is dancing,
brilliant, glittering, and gay, to the utter neglect of the various
passions by which the characters are animated, and the confusion of
time and place--in a word, of good sense itself. Their music is
always laughing: and if by chance the composer in the course of the
drama permits himself for one moment not to be absurd, he at once
hastens back to his prescribed style, his melodious roulades and
<i>grupetti</i>, his trills and contemptible frivolities, either
for voice or orchestra; and these, succeeding so abruptly to
something true to life, have an unreal effect, and give the
<i>opera seria</i> all the appearance of a parody or
caricature.</p>
<p>I could quote plenty of examples from famous works; but speaking
generally of these artistic questions, is it not from Italy that we
get those stereotyped conventional forms adopted by so many French
composers, resisted by Cherubim and Spontini alone among the
Italians, though rejected entirely by the Germans? What
well-organized person with any sense of musical expression could
listen to a quartet in which four characters, animated by totally
conflicting passions, should successively employ the same melodious
phrase to express such different words as these: "O, toi que
j'adore!" "Quelle terreur me glace!" "Mon coeur bat de plaisir!"
"La fureur me transporte!" To suppose that music is a language so
vague that the natural inflections of fury will serve equally well
for fear, joy, and love, only proves the absence of that sense
which to others makes the varieties of expression in music as
incontestable a reality as the existence of the sun.... I regard
the course taken by Italian composers as the inevitable result of
the instincts of the public, which react more or less on the
composers themselves.</p>

<center><b>THE FAMOUS "SNUFF-BOX TREACHERY"</b></center>
<br>
<center>From the Autobiography</center>
<br>
<p>Now for another intrigue, still more cleverly contrived, the
black depths of which I hardly dare fathom. I incriminate no one; I
simply give the naked facts, without the smallest commentary, but
with scrupulous exactness. General Bernard having himself informed
me that my Requiem was to be performed on certain conditions, ... I
was about to begin my rehearsals when I was sent for by the
Director of the Beaux-Arts.</p>
<p>"You know," said he, "that Habeneck has been commissioned to
conduct all the great official musical festivals?" ("Come, good!"
thought I: "here is another tile for my devoted head.") "It is true
that you are now in the habit of conducting the performance of your
works yourself; but Habeneck is an old man" (another tile), "and I
happen to know that he will be deeply hurt if he does not preside
at your Requiem. What terms are you on with him?"</p>
<p>"What terms? We have quarreled. I hardly know why. For three
years he has not spoken to me. I am not aware of his motives, and
indeed have not cared to ask. He began by rudely refusing to
conduct one of my concerts. His behavior towards me has been as
inexplicable as it is uncivil. However, as I see plainly that he
wishes on the present occasion to figure at Marshal
Damr&eacute;mont's ceremony, and as it would evidently be agreeable
to you, I consent to give up the baton to him, on condition that I
have at least one full rehearsal."</p>
<p>"Agreed," replied the Director; "I will let him know about
it."</p>
<p>The rehearsals were accordingly conducted with great care.
Habeneck spoke to me as if our relations with each other had never
been interrupted, and all seemed likely to go well.</p>
<p>The day of the performance arrived, in the Church of the
Invalides, before all the princes, peers, and deputies, the French
press, the correspondents of foreign papers, and an immense crowd.
It was absolutely essential for me to have a great success; a
moderate one would have been fatal, and a failure would have
annihilated me altogether.</p>
<p>Now listen attentively.</p>
<p>The various groups of instruments in the orchestra were
tolerably widely separated, especially the four brass bands
introduced in the 'Tuba mirum,' each of which occupied a corner of
the entire orchestra. There is no pause between the 'Dies
Ir&aelig;' and the 'Tuba mirum,' but the pace of the latter
movement is reduced to half what it was before. At this point the
whole of the brass enters, first all together, and then in
passages, answering and interrupting, each a third higher than the
last. It is obvious that it is of the greatest importance that the
four beats of the new <i>tempo</i> should be distinctly marked, or
else the terrible explosion, which I had so carefully prepared with
combinations and proportions never attempted before or since, and
which, rightly performed, gives such a picture of the Last Judgment
as I believe is destined to live, would be a mere enormous and
hideous confusion.</p>
<p>With my habitual mistrust, I had stationed myself behind
Habeneck, and turning my back on him, overlooked the group of
kettle-drums, which he could not see, when the moment approached
for them to take part in the general melee. There are perhaps one
thousand bars in my Requiem. Precisely in that of which I have just
been speaking, when the movement is retarded, and the wind
instruments burst in with their terrible flourish of trumpets; in
fact, just in <i>the</i> one bar where the conductor's motion is
absolutely indispensable, Habeneck <i>puts down his baton, quietly
takes out his snuff box</i>, and proceeds to take a pinch of snuff.
I always had my eye in his direction, and instantly turned rapidly
on one heel, and springing forward before him, I stretched out my
arm and marked the four great beats of the new movement. The
orchestras followed me, each in order. I conducted the piece to the
end, and the effect which I had longed for was produced. When, at
the last words of the chorus, Habeneck saw that the 'Tuba mirum'
was saved, he said, "What a cold perspiration I have been in!
Without you we should have been lost." "Yes, I know," I answered,
looking fixedly at him. I did not add another word.... Had he done
it on purpose? ... Could it be possible that this man had dared to
join my enemy, the Director, and Cherubini's friends, in plotting
and attempting such rascality? I don't wish to believe it ... but I
cannot doubt it. God forgive me if I am doing the man
injustice!</p>

<center><b>ON GLUCK</b></center>
<br>
<center>From the Autobiography</center>
<br>
<p>Of all the ancient composers, Gluck has, I believe, the least to
fear from the incessant revolutions of art. He sacrificed nothing
either to the caprices of singers, the exigencies of fashion, or
the inveterate routine with which he had to contend on his arrival
in France, after his protracted struggles with the Italian
theatres. Doubtless his conflicts at Milan, Naples, and Parma,
instead of weakening him, had increased his strength by revealing
its full extent to himself; for in spite of the fanaticism then
prevalent in our artistic customs, he broke these miserable
trammels and trod them underfoot with the greatest ease. True, the
clamor of the critics once succeeded in forcing him into a reply;
but it was the only indiscretion with which he had to reproach
himself, and thenceforth, as before, he went straight to his aim in
silence. We all know what that aim was; we also know that it was
never given to any man to succeed more fully. With less conviction
or less firmness, it is probable that, notwithstanding his natural
genius, his degenerate works would not have long survived those of
his mediocre rivals now completely forgotten. But truth of
expression, purity of style, and grandeur of form belong to all
time. Gluck's fine passages will always be fine. Victor Hugo is
right: the heart never grows old.</p>

<center><b>ON BACH</b></center>
<br>
<center>From the Autobiography</center>
<br>
<p>You will not, my dear Demarest, expect an analysis from me of
Bach's great work: such a task would quite exceed my prescribed
limits. Indeed, the movement performed at the Conservatoire three
years ago may be considered the type of the author's style
throughout the work. The Germans profess an unlimited admiration
for Bach's recitatives; but their peculiar characteristic
necessarily escaped me, as I did not understand the language and
was unable to appreciate their expression. Whoever is familiar with
our musical customs in Paris must witness, in order to believe, the
attention, respect, and even reverence with which a German public
listens to such a composition. Every one follows the words on the
book with his eyes; not a movement among the audience, not a murmur
of praise or blame, not a sound of applause; they are listening to
a solemn discourse, they are hearing the gospel sung, they are
attending divine service rather than a concert. And really such
music ought to be thus listened to. They adore Bach, and believe in
him, without supposing for a moment that his divinity could ever be
called into question. A heretic would horrify them, he is forbidden
even to speak of him. God is God and Bach is Bach. Some days after
the performance of Bach's <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>, the Singing Academy
announced Graun's 'Tod Jesu.' This is another sacred work, a holy
book; the worshipers of which are, however, mainly to be found in
Berlin, whereas the religion of Bach is professed throughout the
north of Germany.</p>

<center><b>MUSIC AS AN ARISTOCRATIC ART</b></center>
<br>
<center>From the Autobiography</center>
<br>
<p>Dramatic art in the time of Shakespeare was more appreciated by
the masses than it is in our day by those nations which lay most
claim to possess a feeling for it. Music is essentially
aristocratic; it is a daughter of noble race, such as princes only
can dower nowadays; it must be able to live poor and unmated rather
than form a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>.</p>
<br>
<a name="BERLIOZ_06"></a>
<center><b>THE BEGINNING OF A "GRAND PASSION"</b></center>
<br>
<center>From the Autobiography</center>
<br>
<p>I have now come to the grand drama of my life; but I shall not
relate all its painful details. It is enough to say that an English
company came over to perform Shakespeare's plays, then entirely
unknown in France, at the Od&eacute;on. I was present at the first
performance of 'Hamlet,' and there, in the part of Ophelia, I saw
Miss Smithson, whom I married five years afterward. I can only
compare the effect produced by her wonderful talent, or rather her
dramatic genius, on my imagination and heart, with the convulsion
produced on my mind by the work of the great poet whom she
interpreted. It is impossible to say more.</p>
<p>This sudden and unexpected revelation of Shakespeare overwhelmed
me. The lightning-flash of his genius revealed the whole heaven of
art to me, illuminating its remotest depths in a single flash. I
recognized the meaning of real grandeur, real beauty, and real
dramatic truth; and I also realized the utter absurdity of the
ideas circulated by Voltaire in France about Shakespeare, and the
pitiful pettiness of our old poetic school, the offspring of
pedagogues and <i>fr&egrave;res ignorantins</i>.</p>
<p>But the shock was too great, and it was a long while before I
recovered from it. I became possessed by an intense, overpowering
sense of sadness, that in my then sickly, nervous state produced a
mental condition adequately to describe which would take a great
physiologist. I could not sleep, I lost my spirits, my favorite
studies became distasteful to me, and I spent my time wandering
aimlessly about Paris and its environs. During that long period of
suffering, I can only recall four occasions on which I slept, and
then it was the heavy, death-like sleep produced by complete
physical exhaustion. These were one night when I had thrown myself
down on some sheaves in a field near Ville-Juif; one day in a
meadow in the neighborhood of Sceaux; once on the snow on the banks
of the frozen Seine, near Neuilly; and lastly, on a table in the
Caf&eacute; du Cardinal at the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens
and the Rue Richelieu, where I slept for five hours, to the terror
of the <i>gar&ccedil;ons</i>, who thought I was dead and were
afraid to come near me.</p>
<p>It was on my return from one of these wanderings, in which I
must have seemed like one seeking his soul, that my eyes fell on
Moore's 'Irish Melodies,' lying open on my table at the song
beginning "When he who adores thee." I seized my pen, and then and
there wrote the music to that heart-rending farewell, which is
published at the end of my collection of songs, 'Irlande,' under
the title of 'El&eacute;gie.' This is the only occasion on which I
have been able to vent any strong feeling in music while still
under its influence. And I think that I have rarely reached such
intense truth of musical expression, combined with so much
realistic power of harmony.</p>

<center><b>ON THEATRICAL MANAGERS IN RELATION TO ART</b></center>
<br>
<center>From the 'Autobiography'</center>
<br>
<p>I have often wondered why theatrical managers everywhere have
such a marked predilection for what genuine artists, cultivated
minds, and even a certain section of the public itself persist in
regarding as very poor manufacture, short-lived productions, the
handiwork of which is as valueless as the raw material itself. Not
as though platitudes always succeeded better than good works;
indeed, the contrary is often the case. Neither is it that careful
compositions entail more expense than "shoddy." It is often just
the other way. Perhaps it arises simply from the fact that the good
works demand the care, study, attention, and, in certain cases,
even the mind, talent, and inspiration of every one in the theatre,
from the manager down to the prompter. The others, on the contrary,
being made especially for lazy, mediocre, superficial, ignorant,
and silly people, naturally find a great many supporters. Well! a
manager likes, above everything, whatever brings him in amiable
speeches and satisfied looks from his underlings, he likes things
that require no learning and disturb no accepted ideas or habits,
which gently go with the stream of prejudice, and wound no
self-love, because they reveal no incapacity; in a word, things
which do not take too long to get up.</p>

<h2>SAINT BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX</h2>
<h3>(1091-1153)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-b.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>orn in 1091, at Fontaines, a castle of his father Tescelin, near
Dijon, France, and devotedly instructed by his pious and gentle
mother Aleth, Bernard of Clairvaux was from early childhood imbued
with an active religious enthusiasm. When the time came to choose
his way of life, instead of going into battle with his knighted
brothers, he made them, as well as his uncle the count of Touillon,
join a band of thirty companions, with whom he knelt in the rude
chapel at Citeaux to beg the tonsure from Abbot Stephen Harding. To
rise at two o'clock in the morning and chant the prayer-offices of
the church until nine, to do hard manual labor until two, when the
sole meal of the day--composed of vegetable food only--was taken,
to labor again until nightfall and sing the vespers until an early
bedtime hour: such was the Cistercian's daily observance of his
vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience,--vows which Bernard and
his followers were to lay down only upon the cross of ashes spread
upon the hard cell floor to receive their outstretched, dying
bodies.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-395.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Saint Bernard.</b></p>
<p>Citeaux became famous from the coming of these new recruits.
There was, in those tough old days, a soldierly admiration for
faithfulness to discipline; and when Bernard was professed in 1114,
Abbot Stephen was obliged to enlarge the field of work. Bernard was
sent in 1115 to build a house and clear and cultivate a farm in a
thickly wooded and thief-infested glen to the north of Dijon, known
as the Valley of Wormwood. Here at the age of twenty-four, in a
rude house built by their own hands with timber cut from the land,
the young abbot and his companions lived like the sturdy pioneers
of our Northwest, the earth their floor and narrow wooden bunks in
a low dark loft their beds. Of course the stubborn forest gave way
slowly, and grudgingly opened sunny hillsides to the vine and
wheat-sheaf. The name of the settlement was changed to Clairvaux,
but for many years the poor monks' only food was barley bread, with
broth made from boiled beech leaves. Here Tescelin came in his old
age to live under the rule of his sons; and Humbeline, the wealthy
and rank-proud daughter, one day left her gay retinue at the door
of their little abbey and went to join the nuns at Jouilly.</p>
<p>While Bernard was studying and planting at Clairvaux, the word
of his piety and worth went everywhere through the land, and he
came to be consulted not only by his Superior at Citeaux, but by
villein and noble, even to the august persons of Louis the Fat of
France and Henry the Norman of England. His gentleness and
integrity became the chief reliance of the royal house of France,
and his sermons and letters began to be quoted at council board and
synod even as far as Rome. The austerity and poverty of the
Cistercians had caused some friends of the monks of Cluny to fall
under Bernard's zealous indignation. He wrote to William of St.
Thierry a famous letter, mildly termed an Apology; in which, by the
most insinuating and biting satire, the laxity and indulgence which
had weakened or effaced the power of monastic example (from which
arraignment the proud house of Cluny was deemed not to escape
scot-free) were lashed with uncompromising courage.</p>
<p>France and Burgundy, with the more or less helpful aid of the
Norman dukes in England, had been very loyal to the interests of
the Papacy. When the schism of Anacletus II. arose in 1130,
Innocent II., driven from Rome by the armed followers of Peter de
Leon, found his way at once to the side of Louis VI. There he found
Bernard, and upon him he leaned from that time until the latter had
hewed a road for him back to Rome through kings, prelates,
statesmen, and intriguers, with the same unflinching steadfastness
with which he had cut a way to the sunlight for his vines and
vegetables in the Valley of Wormwood. Bernard it was who persuaded
Henry of England to side with Innocent, and it was he who stayed
the revival of the question of investitures and won the Emperor to
the Pope at Liege. At the Council of Rheims in October 1131,
Bernard was the central figure; and when the path was open for a
return to Italy, the restored Pope took the abbot with him, leaving
in return a rescript releasing Citeaux from tithes. Bernard stayed
in Italy until 1135, and left Innocent secure in Rome.</p>
<p>After a short period of peace at Clairvaux, he had to hurry off
again to Italy on account of the defection of the influential
monastery of Monte Casino to Anacletus.</p>
<p>Not long after his last return from Italy, Bernard met Pierre
Ab&eacute;lard. This brilliant and unfortunate man had incurred the
charge of heresy, and at some time in the year 1139 Bernard was
induced to meet and confer with him. Nothing seems to have resulted
from the conference, for Ab&eacute;lard went in 1140 to the Bishop
of Sens and demanded an opportunity of being confronted with
Bernard at an approaching synod. The abbot of Clairvaux, although
unwilling, was at last persuaded to accept the challenge. Louis
VII., King of France, Count Theobald of Champagne, and the nobles
of the realm assembled to witness the notable contest.
Ab&eacute;lard came with a brilliant following; but on the second
day of the synod, to the surprise of everybody, he abruptly closed
the proceeding by appealing to Rome. The works of Ab&eacute;lard
were condemned, but his appeal and person were respected, and
Bernard prepared a strong condemnatory letter to be sent to the
Pope. As the great scholar was on his way to Rome to follow his
appeal, he stayed to rest at Cluny with Peter the Venerable, who
persuaded him to go to Bernard. When the two great hearts met in
the quiet of Clairvaux, all animosities were resolved in peace; and
Ab&eacute;lard, returning to Cluny, abandoned his appeal and
observed the rule of the house until his death, which he endured,
as Peter the Venerable wrote to H&eacute;loise, fully prepared and
comforted, at Ch&acirc;lons in 1142.</p>
<p>The infidels of the East having taken Edessa in 1146, the power
of the Christians in the Holy Land was broken; and Eugenius III.,
who had been a monk of Clairvaux, appointed Bernard to preach a new
crusade. He set on foot a vast host under the personal leadership
of Louis VII. and Conrad the Emperor, accompanied by Queen Eleanor
and many noble ladies of both realms. The ill fortunes which
attended this war brought to Bernard the greatest bitterness of his
life. So signal was the failure of the Second Crusade, that but a
pitiful remnant of the brilliant army which had crossed the
Bosphorus returned to Europe, and Bernard was assailed with
execration from hut and castle throughout the length of Europe. His
only answer was as gentle as his life: "Better that I be blamed
than God." He did not neglect, however, to point out that the evil
lives and excesses of those who attempted the Crusade were the real
causes of the failure of the Christian arms.</p>
<p>In Languedoc in 1147 he quelled a dangerous heresy, and silenced
Gilbert, bishop of Poitiers, at the Council of Rheims.</p>
<p>In 1148 Malachy, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland,
who nine years before had visited Clairvaux and formed a lasting
friendship for Bernard, came there again to die in the arms of his
friend. It is related that the two saints had exchanged habits upon
the first visit, and that Malachy wore that of Bernard on his
death-bed. The funeral sermon preached by Bernard upon the life and
virtue of his Irish comrade is reputed to be one of the finest
extant. It seemed as if the Gael had come to show the Goth the way
of death. Bernard's health, early broken by self-imposed austerity
and penances, had never been robust, and it had often seemed that
nothing but the vigor of his will had kept him from the grave. In
the year 1153 he was stricken with a fatal illness. Yet when the
archbishop of Tr&egrave;ves came to his bedside, imploring his aid
to put an end to an armed quarrel between the nobles and the people
of Metz, he went cheerfully but feebly to the field between the
contending parties, and by words which came with pain and in the
merest whispers, he persuaded the men who were already at each
other's throats to forget their enmities.</p>
<p>He died at Clairvaux on January 12th, 1153, and was buried, as
he wished, in the habit of Saint Malachy. In 1174 he was sainted,
and his life is honored in the liturgy of the church on the 20th of
August.</p>
<p>The marks of Saint Bernard's character were sweetness and gentle
tolerance in the presence of honest opposition, and implacable
vigor against shams and evil-doing. His was the perfect type of
well-regulated individual judgment. His humility and love of
poverty were true and unalterable. In Italy he refused the mitres
of Genoa and Milan in turn, and in France successively declined the
sees of Ch&acirc;lons, Langres, and Rheims. He wrote and spoke with
simplicity and directness, and with an energy and force of
conviction which came from absolute command of his subject. He did
not disdain to use a good-tempered jest as occasion required, and
his words afford some pleasant examples of na&iuml;ve puns. He was
a tireless letter-writer, and some of his best writings are in that
form. He devoted much labor to his sermons on the Canticle of
Canticles, the work remaining unfinished at his death. He wrote a
long poem on the Passion, one beautiful hymn of which is included
in the Roman Breviary.</p>

<center><b>MONASTIC LUXURY</b></center>
<br>
<center>From the Apology to the Abbot William of St.
Thierry</center>
<br>
<p>There is no conversation concerning the Scriptures, none
concerning the salvation of souls; but small-talk, laughter, and
idle words fill the air. At dinner the palate and ears are equally
tickled--the one with dainties, the other with gossip and news,
which together quite prevent all moderation in feeding. In the mean
time dish after dish is set on the table; and to make up for the
small privation of meat, a double supply is provided of well-grown
fish. When you have eaten enough of the first, if you taste the
second course, you will seem to yourself hardly to have touched the
former: such is the art of the cooks, that after four or five
dishes have been devoured, the first does not seem to be in the way
of the last, nor does satiety invade the appetite.... Who could
say, to speak of nothing else, in how many forms eggs are cooked
and worked up? with what care they are turned in and out, made hard
or soft, or chopped fine; now fried, now roasted, now stuffed; now
they are served mixed with other things, now by themselves. Even
the external appearance of the dishes is such that the eye, as well
as the taste, is charmed....</p>
<p>Not only have we lost the spirit of the old monasteries, but
even its outward appearance. For this habit of ours, which of old
was the sign of humility, by the monks of our day is turned into a
source of pride. We can hardly find in a whole province wherewithal
we condescend to be clothed. The monk and the knight cut their
garments, the one his cowl, the other his cloak, from the same
piece. No secular person, however great, whether king or emperor,
would be disgusted at our vestments if they were only cut and
fitted to his requirements. But, say you, religion is in the heart,
not in the garments? True; but you, when you are about to buy a
cowl, rush over the towns, visit the markets, examine the fairs,
dive into the houses of the merchants, turn over all their goods,
undo their bundles of cloth, feel it with your fingers, hold it to
your eyes or to the rays of the sun, and if anything coarse or
faded appears, you reject it. But if you are pleased with any
object of unusual beauty or brightness, you at once buy it,
whatever the price. I ask you, Does this come from the heart, or
your simplicity?</p>
<p>I wonder that our abbots allow these things, unless it arises
from the fact that no one is apt to blame any error with confidence
if he cannot trust in his own freedom from the same; and it is a
right human quality to forgive without much anger those
self-indulgences in others for which we ourselves have the
strongest inclination. How is the light of the world overshadowed!
Those whose lives should have been the way of life to us, by the
example they give of pride, become blind leaders of the blind. What
a specimen of humility is that, to march with such pomp and
retinue, to be surrounded with such an escort of hairy men, so that
one abbot has about him people enough for two bishops. I lie not
when I say, I have seen an abbot with sixty horses after him, and
even more. Would you not think, as you see them pass, that they
were not fathers of monasteries, but lords of castles--not
shepherds of souls, but princes of provinces? Then there is the
baggage, containing table-cloths, and cups and basins, and
candlesticks, and well-filled wallets--not with the coverlets, but
the ornaments of the beds. My lord abbot can never go more than
four leagues from his home without taking all his furniture with
him, as if he were going to the wars, or about to cross a desert
where necessaries cannot be had. Is it quite impossible to wash
one's hands in, and drink from, the same vessel? Will not your
candle burn anywhere but in that gold or silver candlestick of
yours, which you carry with you? Is sleep impossible except upon a
variegated mattress, or under a foreign coverlet? Could not one
servant harness the mule, wait at dinner, and make the bed? If such
a multitude of men and horses is indispensable, why not at least
carry with us our necessaries, and thus avoid the severe burden we
are to our hosts?...</p>

<b>Monastic Luxury.</b><br>
Photogravure from a Painting by Edward Gr&uuml;tzner.</p>
<br>
<p>By the sight of wonderful and costly vanities men are prompted
to give, rather than to pray. Some beautiful picture of a saint is
exhibited--and the brighter the colors the greater the holiness
attributed to it: men run, eager to kiss; they are invited to give,
and the beautiful is more admired than the sacred is revered. In
the churches are suspended, not <i>coronae</i>, but wheels studded
with gems and surrounded by lights, which are scarcely brighter
than the precious stones which are near them. Instead of
candlesticks, we behold great trees of brass fashioned with
wonderful skill, and glittering as much through their jewels as
their lights. What do you suppose is the object of all this? The
repentance of the contrite, or the admiration of the gazers? O
vanity of vanities! but not more vain than foolish. The church's
walls are resplendent, but the poor are not there.... The curious
find wherewith to amuse themselves; the wretched find no stay for
them in their misery. Why at least do we not reverence the images
of the saints, with which the very pavement we walk on is covered?
Often an angel's mouth is spit into, and the face of some saint
trodden on by passers-by.... But if we cannot do without the
images, why can we not spare the brilliant colors? What has all
this to do with monks, with professors of poverty, with men of
spiritual minds?</p>
<p>Again, in the cloisters, what is the meaning of those ridiculous
monsters, of that deformed beauty, that beautiful deformity, before
the very eyes of the brethren when reading? What are disgusting
monkeys there for, or satyrs, or ferocious lions, or monstrous
centaurs, or spotted tigers, or fighting soldiers, or huntsmen
sounding the bugle? You may see there one head with many bodies, or
one body with numerous heads. Here is a quadruped with a serpent's
tail; there is a fish with a beast's head; there a creature, in
front a horse, behind a goat; another has horns at one end, and a
horse's tail at the other. In fact, such an endless variety of
forms appears everywhere, that it is more pleasant to read in the
stonework than in books, and to spend the day in admiring these
oddities than in meditating on the law of God. Good God! if we are
not ashamed of these absurdities, why do we not grieve at the cost
of them?</p>

<center><b>FROM HIS SERMON ON THE DEATH OF GERARD</b></center>
<br>
<center>"As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon."--Sol.
Song i. 5</center>
<br>
<p>Perhaps both members of the comparison--viz., "As the tents of
Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon"--refer only to the first words,
"I am black." It may be, however, that the simile is extended to
both clauses, and each is compared with each. The former sense is
the more simple, the latter the more obscure. Let us try both,
beginning with the latter, which seems the more difficult. There is
no difficulty, however, in the first comparison, "I am black as the
tents of Kedar," but only in the last. For Kedar, which is
interpreted to mean "darkness" or "gloom," may be compared with
blackness justly enough; but the curtains of Solomon are not so
easily likened to beauty. Moreover, who does not see that "tents"
fit harmoniously with the comparison? For what is the meaning of
"tents" except our bodies, in which we sojourn for a time? Nor have
we an abiding city, but we seek one to come. In our bodies, as
under tents, we carry on warfare. Truly, we are violent to take the
kingdom. Indeed, the life of man here on earth is a warfare; and as
long as we do battle in this body, we are absent from the
Lord,--i.e., from the light. For the Lord is light; and so far as
any one is not in Him, so far he is in darkness, i.e., in Kedar.
Let each one then acknowledge the sorrowful exclamation as his
own:--"Woe is me that my sojourn is prolonged! I have dwelt with
those who dwell in Kedar. My soul hath long sojourned in a strange
land." Therefore this habitation of the body is not the mansion of
the citizen, nor the house of the native, but either the soldier's
tent or the traveler's inn. This body, I say, is a tent, and a tent
of Kedar, because, by its interference, it prevents the soul from
beholding the infinite light, nor does it allow her to see the
light at all, except through a glass darkly, and not face to
face.</p>
<p>Do you not see whence blackness comes to the Church--whence a
certain rust cleaves to even the fairest souls? Doubtless it comes
from the tents of Kedar, from the practice of laborious warfare,
from the long continuance of a painful sojourn, from the straits of
our grievous exile, from our feeble, cumbersome bodies; for the
corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle
weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things. Therefore the
souls' desire to be loosed, that being freed from the body they may
fly into the embraces of Christ. Wherefore one of the miserable
ones said, groaning, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver
me from the body of this death!" For a soul of this kind knoweth
that, while in the tents of Kedar, she cannot be entirely free from
spot or wrinkle, nor from stains of blackness, and wishes to go
forth and to put them off. And here we have the reason why the
spouse calls herself black as the tents of Kedar. But now, how is
she beautiful as the curtains of Solomon? Behind these curtains I
feel that an indescribable holiness and sublimity are veiled, which
I dare not presume to touch, save at the command of Him who
shrouded and sealed the mystery. For I have read, He that is a
searcher of Majesty shall be overwhelmed with the glory. I pass on
therefore. It will devolve on you, meanwhile, to obtain grace by
your prayers, that we may the more readily, because more
confidently, recur to a subject which needs attentive minds; and it
may be that the pious knocker at the door will discover what the
bold explorer seeks in vain.</p>

<h2>BERNARD OF CLUNY</h2>
<h3>Twelfth Century</h3>
<center>BY WILLIAM C. PRIME</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-l.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ittle is known concerning the monk Bernard, sometimes called
Bernard of Morlay and sometimes Bernard of Cluny. The former name
is probably derived from the place of his origin, the latter from
the fact that in the introduction to his poem 'De Contemptu Mundi'
he describes himself as a brother of the monks of Cluny. He lived
in the twelfth century, a period of much learning in the church;
and that he was himself a man of broad scholarship and brilliant
abilities, the Latin poem, his only surviving work, abundantly
testifies.</p>
<p>This poem, divided into three books, consists in all of about
three thousand lines. It is introduced by a short address in prose
to Father Peter, the abbot of the monastery, in which the author
describes the peculiar operations of his mind in undertaking and
accomplishing his marvelous poem. He believes and asserts, "not
arrogantly, but in all humility and therefore boldly," that he had
divine aid. "Unless the spirit of wisdom and understanding had been
with me and filled me, I had never been able to construct so long a
work in such a difficult metre."</p>
<p>This metre is peculiar. In technical terms each line consists of
three parts: the first part including two dactyls, the second part
two dactyls, the third part one dactyl and one trochee. The final
trochee, a long and a short syllable, rhymes with the following or
preceding line. There is also a rhyme, in each line, of the second
dactyl with the fourth. This will be made plain to the ordinary
reader by quoting the first two lines of the poem, divided into
feet:--</p>
<blockquote>Hora no | vissima | tempora | pessima | sunt, vigi |
lemus;<br>
Ecce mi | naciter | imminet | arbiter | ille su |
premus.</blockquote>
<p>The adoption of such a metre would seem to be a clog on
flexibility and force of expression. But in this poem it is not so.
The author rejoices in absolute freedom of diction. The rhythm and
rhyme alike lend themselves to the uses, now of bitter satire and
revilings, now of overpowering hope and exultant joy.</p>
<p>The title scarcely gives an idea of the subject-matter of the
poem. The old Benedictine, living for the time in his cell, had
nevertheless known the world of his day, had lived in it and been
of it. To him it seemed an evil world, full of crimes, of moils, of
deceits, of abominations; the Church seemed corrupt, venal,
shameless, and Rome the centre and the soul of this accursed world.
Pondering on these conditions, the monk turned his weary gaze
toward the celestial country, the country of purity and peace, and
to the King on his throne, the centre and source of eternal
beatitude. The contrast, on which he dwelt for a long time, filled
him on the one hand with burning indignation, on the other with
entrancing visions and longings.</p>
<p>At last he broke out into magnificent poetry. It is not possible
to translate him into any other language than the Latin in which he
wrote, and preserve any of the grandeur and beauty which result
from the union of ardent thought with almost miraculous music of
language. Dr. Neale aptly speaks of the majestic sweetness which
invests Bernard's poem. The expression applies specially to those
passages, abounding in all parts of the poem, in which he describes
the glory and the peace of the better country. Many of these have
been translated or closely imitated by Dr. Neale, with such
excellent effect that several hymns which are very popular in
churches of various denominations have been constructed from Dr.
Neale's translations. Other portions of the poem, especially those
in which the vices and crimes of the Rome of that time are
denounced and lashed with unsparing severity, have never been
translated, and are not likely ever to be, because of the
impossibility of preserving in English the peculiar force of the
metre; and translation without this would be of small value. The
fire of the descriptions of heaven is increased by the contrast in
which they stand with descriptions of Rome in the twelfth century.
Here, for example, is a passage addressed to Rome:--</p>
<blockquote>"Fas mihi dicere, fas mihi scribere 'Roma fuisti,'<br>
Obruta moenibus, obruta moribus, occubuisti.<br>
Urbs ruis inclita, tam modo subdita, quam prius alta:<br>
Quo prius altior, tam modo pressior, et labefacta.<br>
Fas mihi scribere, fas mihi dicere 'Roma, peristi.'<br>
Sunt tua moenia vociferantia 'Roma ruisti.'"</blockquote>
<p>And here is one addressed to the City of God:--</p>
<blockquote>"O sine luxibus, O sine luctibus, O sine lite,<br>
Splendida curia, florida patria, patria vit&aelig;.<br>
Urbs Syon inclita, patria condita littore tuto,<br>
Te peto, te colo, te flagro, te volo, canto, saluto."</blockquote>
<p>While no translation exists of this remarkable work, nor indeed
can be made to reproduce the power and melody of the original, yet
a very good idea of its spirit may be had from the work of Dr. J.
Mason Neale, who made from selected portions this English poem,
which is very much more than what he modestly called it, "a close
imitation." Dr. Neale has made no attempt to reproduce the metre of
the original.</p>

<h2>JULIANA BERNERS</h2>
<h3>(Fifteenth Century)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>bout the year 1475 one William Caxton, a prosperous English wool
merchant of good standing and repute, began printing books. The art
which he introduced into his native country was quickly taken up by
others; first, it seems, by certain monks at St. Albans, and
shortly afterward by Wynkyn de Worde, who had been an apprentice to
Caxton. In 1486 the press at St. Albans issued two books printed in
English, of which one was entitled 'The Boke of St. Albans.' Of
this volume only three perfect copies are known to exist. It is a
compilation of treatises on hawking, on hunting, and on heraldry,
and contained but little evidence as to their authorship. Ten years
later Wynkyn de Worde reprinted the work with additions, under the
following elaborate title, in the fashion of the time:--'Treatyse
perteynynge to Hawkynge, Huntynge, and Fysshynge with an Angle;
also a right noble Treatyse on the Lynage of Coote Armeris; ending
with a Treatyse which specyfyeth of Blasyng of Armys.'</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-412.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Juliana Berners.</b></p>
<p>The authorship of this volume, one of the earliest books printed
in the English language, has generally been ascribed to a certain
(or uncertain) Juliana Berners, Bernes, or Barnes, who lived in the
early part of the fifteenth century, and who is reputed to have
been prioress of the Nunnery of Sopwell,--long since in
ruins,--near St. Albans, and close to the little river Ver, which
still conceals in its quiet pools the speckled trout. If this
attribution be correct, Dame Berners was the first woman to write a
book in English. Although the question of the authorship is by no
means settled, yet it is clear that the printer believed the
treatise on hunting to have been written by this lady, and the
critics now generally assign a portion at least of the volume to
her. In the sixteenth century the book became very popular, and was
reprinted many times.</p>
<p>Of the several treatises it contains, that on fishing has the
greatest interest, an interest increased by the fact that it
probably suggested 'The Compleat Angler' of Izaak Walton, which
appeared one hundred and sixty years later.</p>

<h2>WALTER BESANT</h2>
<h3>(1838-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-w.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>alter Besant, born in Portsmouth, England, in 1838, did not
begin his career as a novelist till he was thirty years old. His
preparation for the works that possess so certain a maturity of
execution, with as certain an ideal of performance, was made at
King's College, London, and afterwards at Christ's College,
Cambridge, where he took mathematical honors. Abandoning his idea
of entering the Church, he taught for seven years in the Royal
College of Mauritius. Ill health compelled his return to England,
and he then took up literature as a profession. His first novel he
had the courage to burn when the first publisher to whom he showed
it refused it.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-415.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Walter Besant.</b></p>
<p>But the succeeding years brought forth 'Studies in Early French
Poetry,' a delicate and scholarly series of essays; an edition of
Rabelais, of whom he is the biographer and disciple, and, with
Professor Palmer, a 'History of Jerusalem,' a work for which he had
equipped himself when secretary of the Palestine Exploration
Fund.</p>
<p>Mr. Besant was also a student in another special field. He knew
his Dickens as no other undergraduate in the University knew that
branch of polite literature, and passed an examination on the
'Pickwick Papers' which the author declared that he himself would
have failed in. By these processes Mr. Besant fitted himself
mentally and socially for the task of story-telling. The relations
of a man of letters to the rest of the world are comprehensively
revealed in the long list of his novels.</p>
<p>From the beginning he was one who comes with a tale "which
holdeth children from play and old men from the chimney corner";
nor is the charm lessened by the sense of a living and kindly voice
addressing the hearer. His novels are easy reading, and do not
contain an obscure sentence. As art is an expression of the
artist's mind, and not a rigid ecclesiastical canon, it may be
expressed in as many formulas as there are artists. Therefore,
while to few readers life casts the rosy reflection that we have
learned to call Besantine, one would not wish it to disappear nor
to be discredited.</p>
<p>It was in the year 1869 that Walter Besant, by a happy chance,
made the acquaintance of James Rice, the editor of Once a Week, and
became a contributor to that magazine. In 1871 that literary
partnership between them began, which is interesting in the history
of collaboration. Mr. Rice had been a barrister, and added legal
lore to Mr. Besant's varied and accurate literary equipment. The
brilliant series of novels that followed includes 'Ready-Money
Morti-boy,' 'My Little Girl,' 'With Harp and Crown,' 'The Golden
Butterfly,' 'The Seamy Side,' and 'The Chaplain of the Fleet.' The
latter story, that of an innocent young country girl left to the
guardianship of her uncle, chaplain of the Fleet prison, by the
death of her father, is delicately and surprisingly original. The
influence of Dickens is felt in the structure of the story, and the
faithful, almost photographic fidelity to locality betrays in whose
footsteps the authors have followed; but the chaplain, though he
belongs to a family whose features are familiar to the readers of
'Little Dorrit' and 'Great Expectations,' has not existed until he
appears in these pages,--pompous, clever, and without principle,
but not lacking in natural affection. The young girl whose
guileless belief in everybody forces the worst people to assume the
characters her purity and innocence endows them with, is to the
foul prison what Picciola was to Charney. Nor will the moralist
find fault with the author whose kind heart teaches him to include
misfortune in his catalogue of virtues.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice died in 1882, and 'All Sorts and Conditions of Men,'
Mr. Besant's first independent novel, appeared the same year. It is
a novel with a purpose, and accomplished its purpose because an
artist's hand was necessary to paint the picture of East London
that met with such a response as the People's Palace. The appeal to
philanthropy was a new one. It was a plea for a little more of the
pleasures and graces of life for the two million of people who
inhabit the east end of the great city. It is not a picture of life
in the lowest phases, where the scenes are as dramatic as in the
highest social world, but a story of human life; the nobility, the
meanness, the pathos of it in hopelessly commonplace surroundings,
where the fight is not a hand-to-hand struggle with bitter poverty
or crime, but with dullness and monotony. The characters in 'All
Sorts and Conditions of Men' are possibly more typical than real,
but one hesitates to question either characters or situation. The
"impossible story" has become true, and the vision that the
enthusiastic young hero and heroine dream has materialized into a
lovely reality.</p>
<p>'The Children of Gibeon' (1884) and 'The World Went Very Well
Then' (1885) are written with the same philanthropic purpose; but
if Sir Walter Besant were not first of all a story-teller, the
possessor of a living voice that holds one spellbound till he has
finished his tale, the reader would be more sensible of the wide
knowledge of the novelist, and his familiarity with life in its
varied forms.</p>
<p>Here are about thirty novels, displaying an intimate knowledge
of many crafts, trades, and professions, the ways of landsman and
voyager, of country and town, of the new world and the old, of
modern charlatanism as shown in 'Herr Paulus,' of the "woman
question" among London Jews as in the 'Rebel Queen,' and the
suggestion of the repose and sufficiency of life's simple needs as
told in 'Call Her Mine' and 'Celia's Arbor.'</p>
<p>In the 'Ivory Gate' the hero is the victim of a remarkable
hallucination; in the story of 'The Inner House' the plummet of
suggestion plunges into depths not sounded before, and the soul's
regeneration is unfolded in the loveliest of parables.</p>
<p>The range of Sir Walter Besant reaches from the somewhat
conventionalized 'Dorothy Forster' to 'St. Katharine's Tower,'
where deep tragedy approaches the melodramatic, or from the
fascination of 'The Master Craftsman' to the 'Wapping Idyll' of the
heaps of miser's treasure. There is largeness of stroke in this
list, and a wide prospect. His humor is of the cheerful outdoor
kind, and the laugh is at foibles rather than weakness. He pays
little attention to fashion in literature, except to give a
good-natured nod to a passing fad.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to classify him under any school. His
stories are not analytical, nor is one conscious of that
painstaking fidelity to art which is no longer classed among the
minor virtues. When he fights, it is with wrong and oppression and
the cheerless monotony of the lives of the poor; but he fights
classes rather than individuals, although certain characters like
Fielding the plagiarist, in 'Armorel of Lyonesse,' are studied from
life. The village of bankrupts in 'All in a Garden Fair' is a
whimsical conceit, like the disguise of Angela in 'All Sorts and
Conditions of Men,' and the double identity of Edmund Gray in 'The
Ivory Gate.' In reading Besant we are constantly reminded that
humanity is wider than the world; and though its simplest facts are
its greatest, there is both interest and edification in
eccentricities.</p>
<p>In 1895 he was made a baronet, and is president of the Society
of Authors, of whom he has been a gallant champion against the
publishers.</p>

<center><b>OLD-TIME LONDON</b></center>
<br>
<center>From Sir Walter Besant's 'London': Harper and
Brothers</center>
<br>
<p>The London house, either in Saxon or Norman time, presented no
kind of resemblance to the Roman villa. It had no cloisters, no
hypocaust, no suite or sequence of rooms. This unlikeness is
another proof, if any were wanting, that the continuity of tenure
had been wholly broken. If the Saxons went into London, as has been
suggested, peaceably, and left the people to carry on their old
life and their trade in their own way, the Roman and British
architecture--no new thing, but a style grown up in course of years
and found fitted to the climate--would certainly have remained.
That, however, was not the case. The Englishman developed his house
from the patriarchal idea.</p>
<p>First, there was the common hall; in this the household lived,
fed, transacted business, and made their cheer in the evenings. It
was built of timber, and to keep out the cold draughts it was
afterwards lined with tapestry. At first they used simple cloths,
which in great houses were embroidered and painted; <i>perches</i>
of various kinds were affixed to the walls, whereon the weapons,
the musical instruments, the cloaks, etc., were hung up. The lord
and lady sat on a high seat; not, I am inclined to think, on a dais
at the end of the hall, which would have been cold for them, but on
a great chair near the fire, which was burning in the middle of the
hall. This fashion long continued. I have myself seen a college
hall warmed by a fire in a brazier burning under the lantern of the
hall. The furniture consisted of benches; the table was laid on
trestles, spread with a white cloth, and removed after dinner; the
hall was open to all who came, on condition that the guest should
leave his weapons at the door.</p>
<p>The floor was covered with reeds, which made a clean, soft, and
warm carpet, on which the company could, if they pleased, lie round
the fire. They had carpets or rugs also, but reeds were commonly
used. The traveler who chances to find himself at the ancient and
most interesting town of Kingston-on-Hull, which very few English
people, and still fewer Americans, have the curiosity to explore,
should visit the Trinity House. There, among many interesting
things, he will find a hall where reeds are still spread, but no
longer so thickly as to form a complete carpet. I believe this to
be the last survival of the reed carpet.</p>
<p>The times of meals were: the breakfast at about nine; the
"noon-meat," or dinner, at twelve; and the "even-meat," or supper,
probably at a movable time, depending on the length of the day.
When lighting was costly and candles were scarce, the hours of
sleep would be naturally longer in winter than in the summer.</p>
<p>In their manner of living the Saxons were fond of vegetables,
especially of the leek, onion, and garlic. Beans they also had
(these were introduced probably at the time when they commenced
intercourse with the outer world), pease, radishes, turnips,
parsley, mint, sage, cress, rue, and other herbs. They had nearly
all our modern fruits, though many show by their names, which are
Latin or Norman, a later introduction. They made use of butter,
honey, and cheese. They drank ale and mead. The latter is still
made, but in small quantities, in Somerset and Hereford shires. The
Normans brought over the custom of drinking wine.</p>
<p>In the earliest times the whole family slept in the common hall.
The first improvement was the erection of the solar, or upper
chamber. This was above the hall, or a portion of it, or over the
kitchen and buttery attached to the hall. The arrangement may be
still observed in many of the old colleges of Oxford or Cambridge.
The solar was first the sleeping-room of the lord and lady; though
afterward it served not only this purpose, but also for an
ante-chamber to the dormitory of the daughters and the
maid-servants. The men of the household still slept in the hall
below. Later on, bed recesses were contrived in the wall, as one
may find in Northumberland at the present day. The bed was
commonly, but not for the ladies of the house, merely a big bag
stuffed with straw. A sheet wrapped round the body formed the only
night-dress. But there were also pillows, blankets, and coverlets.
The early English bed was quite as luxurious as any that followed
after, until the invention of the spring mattress gave a new and
hitherto unhoped-for joy to the hours of night.</p>
<p>The second step in advance was the ladies' bower, a room or
suite of rooms set apart for the ladies of the house and their
women. For the first time, as soon as this room was added, the
women could follow their own vocations of embroidery, spinning, and
needlework of all kinds, apart from the rough and noisy talk of the
men.</p>
<p>The main features, therefore, of every great house, whether in
town or country, from the seventh to the twelfth century, were the
hall, the solar built over the kitchen and buttery, and the ladies'
bower.</p>
<p>There was also the garden. In all times the English have been
fond of gardens. Bacon thought it not beneath his dignity to order
the arrangement of a garden. Long before Bacon, a writer of the
twelfth century describes a garden as it should be. "It should be
adorned on this side with roses, lilies, and the marigold; on that
side with parsley, cost, fennel, southernwood, coriander, sage,
savery, hyssop, mint, vine, dettany, pellitory, lettuce, cresses,
and the peony. Let there be beds enriched with onions, leeks,
garlic, melons, and scallions. The garden is also enriched by the
cucumber, the soporiferous poppy, and the daffodil, and the
acanthus. Nor let pot herbs be wanting, as beet-root, sorrel, and
mallow. It is useful also to the gardener to have anise, mustard,
and wormwood.... A noble garden will give you medlars, quinces, the
pear main, peaches, pears of St. Regle, pomegranates, citrons,
oranges, almonds, dates, and figs." The latter fruits were perhaps
attempted, but one doubts their arriving at ripeness. Perhaps the
writer sets down what he hoped would be some day achieved.</p>
<p>The indoor amusements of the time were very much like our own.
We have a little music in the evening; so did our forefathers. We
sometimes have a little dancing; so did they, but the dancing was
done for them. We go to the theatres to see the mime; in their days
the mime made his theatre in the great man's hall. He played the
fiddle and the harp; he sang songs, he brought his daughter, who
walked on her hands and executed astonishing capers; the gleeman,
minstrel, or jongleur was already as disreputable as when we find
him later on with his <i>ribauderie</i>. Again, we play chess; so
did our ancestors. We gamble with dice; so did they. We feast and
drink together; so did they. We pass the time in talk; so did they.
In a word, as Alphonse Karr put it, the more we change, the more we
remain the same.</p>
<p>Out-of-doors, as Fitz-Stephen shows, the young men skated,
wrestled, played ball, practiced archery, held water tournaments,
baited bull and bear, fought cocks, and rode races. They were also
mustered sometimes for service in the field, and went forth
cheerfully, being specially upheld by the reassuring consciousness
that London was always on the winning side.</p>
<p>The growth of the city government belongs to the history of
London. Suffice it here to say that the people in all times enjoyed
a freedom far above that possessed by any other city of Europe. The
history of municipal London is a history of continual struggle to
maintain this freedom against all attacks, and to extend it and to
make it impregnable. Already the people are proud, turbulent, and
confident in their own strength. They refuse to own any other lord
but the king himself; there is no Earl of London. They freely hold
their free and open meetings, their folk-motes,--in the open space
outside the northwest corner of St. Paul's Churchyard. That they
lived roughly, enduring cold, sleeping in small houses in narrow
courts; that they suffered much from the long darkness of winter;
that they were always in danger of fevers, agues, "putrid" throats,
plagues, fires by night, and civil wars; that they were ignorant of
letters,--three schools only for the whole of London,--all this may
very well be understood. But these things do not make men and women
wretched. They were not always suffering from preventable disease;
they were not always hauling their goods out of the flames; they
were not always fighting. The first and most simple elements of
human happiness are three; to wit, that a man should be in bodily
health, that he should be free, that he should enjoy the produce of
his own labor. All these things the Londoner possessed under the
Norman kings nearly as much as in these days they can be possessed.
His city has always been one of the healthiest in the world;
whatever freedom could be attained he enjoyed; and in that rich
trading town all men who worked lived in plenty.</p>
<p>The households, the way of living, the occupations of the women,
can be clearly made out in every detail from the Anglo-Saxon
literature. The women in the country made the garments, carded the
wool, sheared the sheep, washed the things, beat the flax, ground
the corn, sat at the spinning-wheel, and prepared the food. In the
towns they had no shearing to do, but all the rest of their duty
fell to their province. The English women excelled in embroidery.
"English" work meant the best kind of work. They worked church
vestments with gold and pearls and precious stones. "Orfrey," or
embroidery in gold, was a special art. Of course they are accused
by the ecclesiastics of an overweening desire to wear finery; they
certainly curled their hair, and, one is sorry to read, they
painted, and thereby spoiled their pretty cheeks. If the man was
the hlaf-ord [lord],--the owner or winner of the loaf,--the wife
was the hlaf-dig [lady], its distributor; the servants and the
retainers were hlaf-oetas, or eaters of it. When nunneries began to
be founded, the Saxon ladies in great numbers forsook the world for
the cloister. And here they began to learn Latin, and became able
at least to carry on correspondence--specimens of which still
exist--in that language. Every nunnery possessed a school for
girls. They were taught to read and to write their own language and
Latin, perhaps also rhetoric and embroidery. As the pious Sisters
were fond of putting on violet chemises, tunics, and vests of
delicate tissue, embroidered with silver and gold, and scarlet
shoes, there was probably not much mortification of the flesh in
the nunneries of the later Saxon times.</p>
<p>This for the better class. We cannot suppose that the daughters
of the craftsmen became scholars of the nunnery. Theirs were the
lower walks--to spin the linen and to make the bread and carry on
the housework.</p>

<center><b>THE SYNAGOGUE</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'The Rebel Queen': Harper and Brothers</center>
<br>
<blockquote>"D'un jour int&eacute;rieur je me sens
&eacute;clair&eacute;,<br>
Et j'entends une voix qui me dit
d'esp&eacute;rer."--LAMARTINE.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>"Are you ready, Francesca?"</p>
<p>Nelly ran lightly down the narrow stairs, dressed for Sabbath
and Synagogue. She was dainty and pretty at all times in the matter
of dress, but especially on a summer day, which affords opportunity
for bright color and bright drapery and an ethereal appearance.
This morning she was full of color and light. When, however, she
found herself confronted with Francesca's simple gray dress, so
closely fitting, so faultless, and her black-lace hat with its
single rose for color, Nelly's artistic sense caused her heart to
sink like lead. It is not for nothing that one learns and teaches
the banjo; one Art leads to another; she who knows music can feel
for dress. "Oh!" she cried, clasping her hands. "That's what we can
never do!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"That fit! Look at me! Yet they call me clever. Clara gives me
the new fashions and I copy them, and the girls in our street copy
me--poor things!--and the dressmaker comes to talk things over and
to learn from me. I make everything for myself. And they call me
clever! But I can't get near it; and if I can't nobody can."...</p>
<p>A large detached structure of red brick stood east and west,
with a flat fa&ccedil;ade and round windows that bore out the truth
of the date--1700--carved upon the front. A word or two in that
square character--that tongue which presents so few attractions to
most of us compared with other tongues--probably corroborated the
internal evidence of the fa&ccedil;ade and the windows.</p>
<p>"This is the synagogue," said Nelly. She entered, and turning to
the right, led the way up-stairs to a gallery running along the
whole side of the building. On the other side was another gallery.
In front of both was a tolerably wide grill, through which the
congregation below could be seen perfectly.</p>
<p>"This is the women's gallery," whispered Nell--there were not
many women present. "We'll sit in the front. Presently they will
sing. They sing beautifully. Now they're reading prayers and the
Law. They've got to read the whole Law through once a week, you
know." Francesca looked curiously through the grill. When one is in
a perfectly strange place, the first observations made are of small
and unimportant things. She observed that there was a circular
inclosure at the east end, as if for an altar; but there was no
altar: two doors indicated a cupboard in the wall. There were six
tall wax-lights burning round the inclosure, although the morning
was fine and bright. At the west end a high screen kept the
congregation from the disturbance of those who entered or went out.
Within the screen was a company of men and boys, all with their
hats and caps on their heads; they looked like the choir. In front
of the choir was a platform railed round. Three chairs were placed
at the back of the platform. There was a table covered with red
velvet, on which lay the book of the Law, a ponderous roll of
parchment provided with silver staves or handles. Before this desk
or table stood the Reader. He was a tall and handsome man, with
black hair and full black beard, about forty years of age. He wore
a gown and large Geneva bands, like a Presbyterian minister; on his
head he had a kind of biretta. Four tall wax candles were placed
round the front of the platform. The chairs were occupied by two or
three elders. A younger man stood at the desk beside the Reader.
The service was already begun--it was, in fact, half over.</p>
<p>Francesca observed next that all the men wore a kind of broad
scarf, made of some white stuff about eight feet long and four feet
broad. Bands of black or blue were worked in the ends, which were
also provided with fringes. "It is the Talleth," Nelly whispered.
Even the boys wore this white robe, the effect of which would have
been very good but for the modern hat, tall or pot, which spoiled
all. Such a robe wants a turban above it, not an English hat. The
seats were ranged along the synagogue east and west. The place was
not full, but there were a good many worshipers. The service was
chanted by the Reader. It was a kind of chant quite new and strange
to Francesca. Like many young persons brought up with no other
religion than they can pick up for themselves, she was curious and
somewhat learned in the matter of ecclesiastical music and ritual,
which she approached, owing to her education, with unbiased mind.
She knew masses and anthems and hymns and chants of all kinds;
never had she heard anything of this kind before. It was not
congregational, or Gregorian; nor was it repeated by the choir from
side to side; nor was it a monotone with a drop at the end; nor was
it a florid, tuneful chant such as one may hear in some Anglican
services. This Reader, with a rich, strong voice, a baritone of
great power, took nearly the whole of the service--it must have
been extremely fatiguing--upon himself, chanting it from beginning
to end. No doubt, as he rendered the reading and the prayers, so
they had been given by his ancestors in Spain and Portugal
generation after generation, back into the times when they came
over in Phoenician ships to the Carthaginian colonies, even before
the dispersion of the Ten Tribes. It was a traditional chant of
antiquity beyond record--not a monotonous chant. Francesca knew
nothing of the words; she grew tired of trying to make out
whereabouts on the page the Reader might be in the book lent her,
which had Hebrew on one side and English on the other. Besides, the
man attracted her--by his voice, by his energy, by his appearance.
She closed her book and surrendered herself to the influence of the
voice and the emotions which it expressed.</p>
<p>There was no music to help him. From time to time the men in the
congregation lifted up their voices--not seemingly in response, but
as if moved to sudden passion and crying out with one accord. This
helped him a little, otherwise he was without any assistance.</p>
<p>A great Voice. The man sometimes leaned over the Roll of the
Law, sometimes he stood upright, always his great Voice went up and
down and rolled along the roof and echoed along the benches of the
women's gallery. Now the Voice sounded a note of rejoicing; now,
but less often, a note of sadness; now it was a sharp and sudden
cry of triumph. Then the people shouted with him--it was as if they
clashed sword on shield and yelled for victory; now it was a note
of defiance, as when men go forth to fight an enemy; now it sank to
a murmur, as of one who consoles and soothes and promises things to
come; now it was a note of rapture, as if the Promised Land was
already recovered.</p>
<p>Was all that in the Voice? Did the congregation, all sitting
wrapped in their white robes, feel these emotions as the Voice
thundered and rolled? I know not. Such was the effect produced upon
one who heard this Voice for the first time. At first it seemed
loud, even barbaric; there was lacking something which the listener
and stranger had learned to associate with worship. What was it?
Reverence? But she presently found reverence In plenty, only of a
kind that differed from that of Christian worship. Then the
listener made another discovery. In this ancient service she missed
the note of humiliation. There was no Litany at a Faldstool. There
was no kneeling in abasement; there was no appearance of penitence,
sorrow, or the confession of sins. The Voice was as the Voice of a
Captain exhorting his soldiers to fight. The service was warlike,
the service of a people whose trust in their God is so great that
they do not need to call perpetually upon Him for the help and
forgiveness of which they are assured. Yes, yes--she thought--this
is the service of a race of warriors; they are fighting men: the
Lord is their God; He is leading them to battle: as for little
sins, and backslidings, and penitences, they belong to the Day of
Atonement--which comes once a year. For all the other days in the
year, battle and victory occupy all the mind. The service of a
great fighting people; a service full of joy, full of faith, full
of assurance, full of hope and confidence--such assurance as few
Christians can understand, and of faith to which few Christians can
attain. Perhaps Francesca was wrong; but these were her first
impressions, and these are mostly true.</p>
<p>In the body of the synagogue men came late. Under one gallery
was a school of boys, in the charge of a graybeard, who, book in
hand, followed the service with one eye, while he admonished
perpetually the boys to keep still and to listen. The boys grew
restless; it was tedious to them--the Voice which expressed so much
to the stranger who knew no Hebrew at all was tedious to the
children; they were allowed to get up and run into the court
outside and then to come back again; nobody heeded their going in
and out. One little boy of three, wrapped, like the rest, in a
white Talleth, ran up and down the side aisle without being
heeded--even by the splendid Beadle with the gold-laced hat, which
looked so truly wonderful above the Oriental Talleth. The boys in
the choir got up and went in and out just as they pleased. Nobody
minded. The congregation, mostly well-to-do men with silk hats, sat
in their places, book in hand, and paid no attention.</p>
<p>Under the opposite gallery sat two or three rows of worshipers,
who reminded Francesca of Browning's poem of St. John's Day at
Rome. For they nudged and jostled each other; they whispered
things; they even laughed over the things they whispered. But they
were clad like those in the open part in the Talleth, and they sat
book in hand, and from time to time they raised their voices with
the congregation. They showed no reverence except that they did not
talk or laugh loudly. They were like the children, their
neighbors,--just as restless, just as uninterested, just as
perfunctory. Well, they were clearly the poorer and the more
ignorant part of the community. They came here and sat through the
service because they were ordered so to do; because, like Passover,
and the Feast of Tabernacles, and the Fast of Atonement, it was the
Law of their People.</p>
<p>The women in the gallery sat or stood. They neither knelt nor
sang aloud; they only sat when it was proper to sit, or stood when
it was proper to stand. They were like the women, the village
women, in a Spanish or Italian church, for whom everything is done.
Francesca, for the moment, felt humiliated that she should be
compelled to sit apart from the congregation, railed off in the
women's gallery, to have her religion done for her, without a voice
of her own in it at all. So, I have heard, indignation sometimes
fills the bosom of certain ladies when they reflect upon the fact
that they are excluded from the choir, and forbidden even to play
the organ in their own parish church.</p>
<p>The chanting ceased; the Reader sat down. Then the Choir began.
They sang a hymn--a Hebrew hymn--the rhythm and metre were not
English; the music was like nothing that can be heard in a
Christian Church. "It is the music," said Nelly, "to which the
Israelites crossed the Red Sea:" a bold statement, but--why not? If
the music is not of Western origin and character, who can disprove
such an assertion? After the hymn the prayers and reading went on
again.</p>
<p>There came at last--it is a long service, such as we poor
weak-kneed Anglicans could not endure--the end. There was a great
bustle and ceremony on the platform; they rolled up the Roll of the
Law; they wrapped it in a purple velvet cloth; they hung over it a
silver breastplate set with twelve jewels for the Twelve Tribes--in
memory of the Urim and Thummim. Francesca saw that the upper ends
of the staves were adorned with silver pomegranates and with silver
bells, and they placed it in the arms of one of those who had been
reading the law; then a procession was formed, and they walked,
while the Choir sang one of the Psalms of David--but not in the
least like the same Psalm sung in an English Cathedral--bearing the
Roll of the Law to the Ark, that is to say, to the cupboard, behind
the railing and inclosure at the east end.</p>
<p>The Reader came back. Then with another chanted Prayer--it
sounded like a prolonged shout of continued Triumph--he ended his
part of the service.</p>
<p>And then the choir sang the last hymn--a lovely hymn, not in the
least like a Christian, or at least an English hymn--a psalm that
breathed a tranquil hope and a perfect faith. One needed no words
to understand the full meaning and beauty and depth of that
hymn.</p>
<p>The service was finished. The men took off their white scarfs
and folded them up. They stood and talked in groups for a few
minutes, gradually melting away. As for the men under the gallery,
who had been whispering and laughing, they trooped out of the
synagogue all together. Evidently, to them the service was only a
form. What is it, in any religion, but a form, to the baser
sort?</p>
<p>The Beadle put out the lights. Nelly led the way down the
stairs. Thinking of what the service had suggested to herself---
all those wonderful things above enumerated--Francesca wondered
what it meant to a girl who heard it every Sabbath morning. But she
refrained from asking. Custom too often takes the symbolism out of
the symbols and the poetry out of the verse. Then the people begin
to worship the symbols and make a fetich of the words. We have seen
this elsewhere--in other forms of faith. Outside they found
Emanuel. They had not seen him in the congregation, probably
because it is difficult to recognize a man merely by the top of his
hat.</p>
<p>"Come," he said, "let us look around the place. Afterwards,
perhaps, we will talk of our Service. This synagogue is built on
the site of the one erected by Manasseh and his friends when Oliver
Cromwell permitted them to return to London after four hundred
years of exile. They were forced to wear yellow hats at first, but
that ordinance soon fell into disuse, like many other abominable
laws. When you read about mediaeval laws, Francesca, remember that
when they were cruel or stupid they were seldom carried into
effect, because the arm of the executive was weak. Who was there to
oblige the Jews to wear the yellow hat? The police? There were no
police. The people? What did the people care about the yellow hat?
When the Fire burned down London, sparing not even the great
Cathedral, to say nothing of the Synagogue, this second Temple
arose, equal in splendor to the first. At that time all the Jews in
London were Sephardim of Spain and Portugal and Italy. Even now
there are many of the people here who speak nothing among
themselves but Spanish, just as there are Askenazim who speak
nothing among themselves but Yiddish. Come with me; I will show you
something that will please you."</p>
<p>He led the way into another flagged court, larger than the
first. There were stone staircases, mysterious doorways, paved
passages, a suggestion of a cloister, an open space or square, and
buildings on all sides with windows opening upon the court.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look English at all," said Francesca. "I have seen
something like it in a Spanish convent. With balconies and a few
bright hangings and a black-haired woman at the open windows, and
perhaps a coat of arms carved upon the wall, it would do for part
of a Spanish street. It is a strange place to find in the heart of
London."</p>
<p>"You see the memory of the Peninsula. What were we saying
yesterday? Spain places her own seal upon everything that belongs
to her--people, buildings, all. What you see here is the central
Institute of our People, the Sephardim--the Spanish part of our
People. Here is our synagogue, here are schools, alms-houses,
residence of the Rabbi, and all sorts of things. You can come here
sometimes and think of Spain, where your ancestors lived. Many
generations in Spain have made you--as they have made me--a
Spaniard."</p>
<p>They went back to the first court. On their way out, as they
passed the synagogue, there came running across the court a girl of
fifteen or so. She was bareheaded; a mass of thick black hair was
curled round her shapely head; her figure was that of an English
girl of twenty; her eyes showed black and large and bright as she
glanced at the group standing in the court; her skin was dark; she
was oddly and picturesquely dressed in a grayish-blue skirt, with a
bright crimson open jacket. The color seemed literally to strike
the eye. The girl disappeared under a doorway, leaving a picture of
herself in Francesca's mind--a picture to be remembered.</p>
<p>"A Spanish Jewess," said Emanuel. "An Oriental. She chooses by
instinct the colors that her great-grandmother might have worn to
grace the triumph of David the King."</p>

<h2>BESTIARIES AND LAPIDARIES</h2>
<h3>BY L. OSCAR KUHNS</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-o.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ne of the marked features of literary investigation during the
present century is the interest which it has manifested in the
Middle Ages. Not only have specialists devoted themselves to the
detailed study of the Sagas of the North and the great cycles of
Romance in France and England, but the stories of the Edda, of the
Nibelungen, and of Charlemagne and King Arthur have become
popularized, so that to-day they are familiar to the general
reader. There is one class of literature, however, which was
widespread and popular during the Middle Ages, but which is to-day
known only to the student,--that is, the so-called Bestiaries and
Lapidaries, or collections of stories and superstitions concerning
the marvelous attributes of animals and of precious stones.</p>
<p>The basis of all Bestiaries is the Greek Physiologus, the origin
of which can be traced back to the second century before Christ. It
was undoubtedly largely influenced by the zo&ouml;logy of the
Bible; and in the references to the Ibex, the Phoenix, and the tree
Paradixion, traces of Oriental and old Greek superstitions can be
seen. It was from the Latin versions of the Greek original that
translations were made into nearly all European languages. There
are extant to-day, whole or in fragments, Bestiaries in German, Old
English, Old French, Proven&ccedil;al, Icelandic, Italian,
Bohemian, and even Armenian, Ethiopic, and Syriac. These various
versions differ more or less in the arrangement and number of the
animals described, but all point back to the same ultimate
source.</p>
<p>The main object of the Bestiaries was not so much to impart
scientific knowledge, as by means of symbols and allegories to
teach the doctrines and mysteries of the Church: At first this
symbolical application was short and concise, but later became more
and more expanded, until it often occupied more space than the
description of the animal which served as a text.</p>
<p>Some of these animals are entirely fabulous, such as the siren,
the phoenix, the unicorn; others are well known, but possess
certain fabulous attributes. The descriptions of them are not the
result of personal observation, but are derived from stories told
by travelers or read in books, or are merely due to the imagination
of the author; these stories, passing down from hand to hand,
gradually became accepted facts.</p>
<p>These books were enormously popular during the Middle Ages, a
fact which is proved by the large number of manuscripts still
extant. Their influence on literature was likewise very great. To
say nothing of the encyclopaedic works,--such as 'Li Tresors' of
Brunetto Latini, the 'Image du Monde,' the 'Roman de la
Rose,'--which contain extracts from the Bestiaries,--there are many
references to them in the great writers, even down to the present
day. There are certain passages in Dante, Chaucer, and Shakespeare,
that would be unintelligible without some knowledge of these
mediaeval books of zo&ouml;logy.</p>
<p>Hence, besides the interest inherent in these quaint and
childish stories, besides their value in revealing the scientific
spirit and attainments of the times, some knowledge of the
Bestiaries is of undoubted value and interest to the student of
literature.</p>
<p>Closely allied to the Bestiaries (and indeed often contained in
the same manuscript) are the Lapidaries, in which are discussed the
various kinds of precious stones, with their physical
characteristics,--shape, size, color, their use in medicine, and
their marvelous talismanic properties. In spite of the fact that
they contain the most absurd fables and superstitions, they were
actually used as text-books in the schools, and published in
medical treatises. The most famous of them was written in Latin by
Marbode, Bishop of Rennes (died in 1123), and translated many times
into Old French and other languages.</p>
<p>The following extracts from the Bestiaries are translated from
'Le Bestiaire' of Guillaume Le Clerc, composed in the year 1210
(edited by Dr. Robert Reinsch, Leipzig, 1890). While endeavoring to
retain somewhat of the quaintness and na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the
original, I have omitted those repetitions and tautological
expressions which are so characteristic of mediaeval literature.
The religious application of the various animals is usually very
long, and often is the mere repetition of the same idea. The
symbolical meaning of the lion here given may be taken as a type of
all the rest.</p>

<a name="BESTIARIES_01"></a>
<center><b>THE LION</b></center>
<br>
<p>It is proper that we should first speak of the nature of the
lion, which is a fierce and proud beast and very bold. It has three
especially peculiar characteristics. In the first place it always
dwells upon a high mountain. From afar off it can scent the hunter
who is pursuing it. And in order that the latter may not follow it
to its lair it covers over its tracks by means of its tail. Another
wonderful peculiarity of the lion is that when it sleeps its eyes
are wide open, and clear and bright. The third characteristic is
likewise very strange. For when the lioness brings forth her young,
it falls to the ground, and gives no sign of life until the third
day, when the lion breathes upon it and in this way brings it back
to life again.</p>
<p>The meaning of all this is very clear. When God, our Sovereign
father, who is the Spiritual lion, came for our salvation here upon
earth, so skillfully did he cover his tracks that never did the
hunter know that this was our Savior, and nature marveled how he
came among us. By the hunter you must understand him who made man
to go astray and seeks after him to devour him. This is the Devil,
who desires only evil.</p>
<p>When this lion was laid upon the Cross by the Jews, his enemies,
who judged him wrongfully, his human nature suffered death. When he
gave up the spirit from his body, he fell asleep upon the holy
cross. Then his divine nature awoke. This must you believe if you
wish to live again.</p>
<p>When God was placed in the tomb, he was there only three days,
and on the third day the Father breathed upon him and brought him
to life again, just as the lion did to its young.</p>
<br>
<a name="BESTIARIES_02"></a>
<center><b>THE PELICAN</b></center>
<br>
<p>The pelican is a wonderful bird which dwells in the region about
the river Nile. The written history<a name="FNanchor4"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_4">[4]</a> tells us that there are two kinds,--those
which dwell in the river and eat nothing but fish, and those which
dwell in the desert and eat only insects and worms. There is a
wonderful thing about the pelican, for never did mother-sheep love
her lamb as the pelican loves its young. When the young are born,
the parent bird devotes all his care and thought to nourishing
them. But the young birds are ungrateful, and when they have grown
strong and self-reliant they peck at their father's face, and he,
enraged at their wickedness, kills them all.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor4">[4]</a>
The reference here is probably to the 'Liber de Bestiis et Aliis
Rebus' of Hugo de St. Victor.</blockquote>
<p>On the third day the father comes to them, deeply moved with
pity and sorrow. With his beak he pierces his own side, until the
blood flows forth. With the blood he brings back life into the body
of his young<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5">[5]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor5">[5]</a>
There are many allusions in literature to this story. Cf.
Shakespeare,--
<blockquote>"Like the kind life-rendering pelican,<br>
Repast them with my blood."--'Hamlet,' iv. 5.</blockquote>
"Those pelican daughters."--Lear, iii. 4. Cf. also the beautiful
metaphor of Alfred de Musset, in his 'Nuit de Mai.'</blockquote>
<br>
<a name="BESTIARIES_03"></a>
<center><b>THE EAGLE</b></center>
<br>
<p>The eagle is the king of birds. When it is old it becomes young
again in a very strange manner. When its eyes are darkened and its
wings are heavy with age, it seeks out a fountain clear and pure,
where the water bubbles up and shines in the clear sunlight. Above
this fountain it rises high up into the air, and fixes its eyes
upon the light of the sun and gazes upon it until the heat thereof
sets on fire its eyes and wings. Then it descends down into the
fountain where the water is clearest and brightest, and plunges and
bathes three times, until it is fresh and renewed and healed of its
old age<a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6">[6]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor6">[6]</a>
"Bated like eagles having lately bathed."--'I Henry IV.,' iv.
I.</blockquote>
<p>The eagle has such keen vision, that if it is high up among the
clouds, soaring through the air, it sees the fish swimming beneath
it, in river or sea; then down it shoots upon the fish and seizes
and drags it to the shore. Again, if unknown to the eagle its eggs
should be changed and others put into its nest,--when the young are
grown, before they fly away, it carries them up into the air when
the sun is shining its brightest. Those which can look at the rays
of the sun, without blinking, it loves and holds dear; those which
cannot stand to look at the light, it abandons, as base-born, nor
troubles itself henceforth concerning them<a name=
"FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7">[7]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor7">[7]</a>
<blockquote>"Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,<br>
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun."--'3 Henry VI.,' ii.
I.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<br>
<a name="BESTIARIES_04"></a>
<center><b>THE PHOENIX</b></center>
<br>
<p>There is a bird named the phoenix, which dwells in India and is
never found elsewhere. This bird is always alone and without
companion, for its like cannot be found, and there is no other bird
which resembles it in habits or appearance<a name=
"FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8">[8]</a>. At the end of five
hundred years it feels that it has grown old, and loads itself with
many rare and precious spices, and flies from the desert away to
the city of Leopolis. There, by some sign or other, the coming of
the bird is announced to a priest of that city, who causes fagots
to be gathered and placed upon a beautiful altar, erected for the
bird. And so, as I have said, the bird, laden with spices, comes to
the altar, and smiting upon the hard stone with its beak, it causes
the flame to leap forth and set fire to the wood and the spices.
When the fire is burning brightly, the phoenix lays itself upon the
altar and is burned to dust and ashes.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor8">[8]</a>
"Were man as rare as phoenix."--'As You Like It,' iv.
3.</blockquote>
<p>Then comes the priest and finds the ashes piled up, and
separating them softly he finds within a little worm, which gives
forth an odor sweeter than that of roses or of any other flower.
The next day and the next the priest comes again, and on the third
day he finds that the worm has become a full-grown and full-fledged
bird, which bows low before him and flies away, glad and joyous,
nor returns again before five hundred years<a name=
"FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9">[9]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor9">[9]</a>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But
as when<br>
The Bird of Wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,<br>
;Her ashes new create another heir."--'Henry VIII.,' v.
5.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<br>
<a name="BESTIARIES_05"></a>
<center><b>THE ANT</b></center>
<br>
<p>There is another kind of ant up in Ethiopia, which is of the
shape and size of dogs. They have strange habits, for they scratch
into the ground and extract therefrom great quantities of fine
gold. If any one wishes to take this gold from them, he soon
repents of his undertaking; for the ants run upon him, and if they
catch him they devour him instantly. The people who live near them
know that they are fierce and savage, and that they possess a great
quantity of gold, and so they have invented a cunning trick. They
take mares which have unweaned foals, and give them no food for
three days. On the fourth the mares are saddled, and to the saddles
are fastened boxes that shine like gold. Between these people and
the ants flows a very swift river. The famished mares are driven
across this river, while the foals are kept on the hither side. On
the other side of the river the grass is rich and thick. Here the
mares graze, and the ants seeing the shining boxes think they have
found a good place to hide their gold, and so all day long they
fill and load the boxes with their precious gold, till night comes
on and the mares have eaten their fill. When they hear the neighing
of their foals they hasten to return to the other side of the
river. There their masters take the gold from the boxes and become
rich and powerful, but the ants grieve over their loss.</p>
<br>
<a name="BESTIARIES_06"></a>
<center><b>THE SIREN</b></center>
<br>
<p>The siren is a monster of strange fashion, for from the waist up
it is the most beautiful thing in the world, formed in the shape of
a woman. The rest of the body is like a fish or a bird. So sweetly
and beautifully does she sing that they who go sailing over the
sea, as soon as they hear the song, cannot keep from going towards
her. Entranced by the music, they fall asleep in their boat, and
are killed by the siren before they can utter a cry<a name=
"FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10">[10]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_10"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor10">[10]</a> References to the siren are innumerable; the
most famous perhaps is Heine's 'Lorelei.' Cf. also Dante,
'Purgatorio,' xix. 19-20.</blockquote>
<br>
<a name="BESTIARIES_07"></a>
<center><b>THE WHALE</b></center>
<br>
<p>In the sea, which is mighty and vast, are many kinds of fish,
such as the turbot, the sturgeon, and the porpoise. But there is
one monster, very treacherous and dangerous. In Latin its name is
Cetus. It is a bad neighbor for sailors. The upper part of its back
looks like sand, and when it rises from the sea, the mariners think
it is an island. Deceived by its size they sail toward it for
refuge, when the storm comes upon them. They cast anchor, disembark
upon the back of the whale, cook their food, build a fire, and in
order to fasten their boat they drive great stakes into what seems
to them to be sand. When the monster feels the heat of the fire
which burns upon its back, it plunges down into the depths of the
sea, and drags the ship and all the people after it.</p>
<p>When the fish is hungry it opens its mouth very wide, and
breathes forth an exceedingly sweet odor. Then all the little fish
stream thither, and, allured by the sweet smell, crowd into its
throat. Then the whale closes its jaws and swallows them into its
stomach, which is as wide as a valley<a name=
"FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11">[11]</a>.</p>

<br>
<a name="BESTIARIES_08"></a>
<center><b>THE CROCODILE</b></center>
<br>
<p>The crocodile is a fierce beast that lives always beside the
river Nile. In shape it is somewhat like an ox; it is full twenty
ells long, and as big around as the trunk of a tree. It has four
feet, large claws, and very sharp teeth; by means of these it is
well armed. So hard and tough is its skin, that it minds not in the
least hard blows made by sharp stones. Never was seen another such
a beast, for it lives on land and in water. At night it is
submerged in water, and during the day it reposes upon the land. If
it meets and overcomes a man, it swallows him entire, so that
nothing remains. But ever after it laments him as long as it
lives<a name="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12">[12]</a>. The
upper jaw of this beast is immovable when it eats, and the lower
one alone moves. No other living creature has this peculiarity. The
other beast of which I have told you (the water-serpent), which
always lives in the water, hates the crocodile with a mortal
hatred. When it sees the crocodile sleeping on the ground with its
mouth wide open, it rolls itself in the slime and mud in order to
become more slippery. Then it leaps into the throat of the
crocodile and is swallowed down into its stomach. Here it bites and
tears its way out again, but the crocodile dies on account of its
wounds.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_12"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor12">[12]</a> "Crocodile tears" are proverbial. Cf:
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the
mournful crocodile<br>
With sorrow snares relenting passengers."--'2 Henry VI.,' iii.

<center><b>THE TURTLE-DOVE</b></center>
<br>
<p>Now I must tell you of another bird which is courteous and
beautiful, and which loves much and is much loved. This is the
turtle-dove. The male and the female are always together in
mountain or in desert, and if perchance the female loses her
companion never more will she cease to mourn for him, never more
will she sit upon green branch or leaf. Nothing in the world can
induce her to take another mate, but she ever remains loyal to her
husband. When I consider the faithfulness of this bird, I wonder at
the fickleness of man and woman. Many husbands and wives there are
who do not love as the turtle-dove; but if the man bury his wife,
before he has eaten two meals he desires to have another woman in
his arms. The turtle-dove does not so, but remains patient and
faithful to her companion, waiting if haply he might return<a name=
"FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13">[13]</a>.</p>

<center><b>THE MANDRAGORA</b></center>
<br>
<p>The mandragora is a wild plant, the like of which does not
exist. Many kinds of medicine can be made of its root; this root,
if you look at it closely, will be seen to have the form of a man.
The bark is very useful; when well boiled in water it helps many
diseases. The skillful physicians gather this plant when it is old,
and they say that when it is plucked it weeps and cries, and if any
one hears the cry he will die<a name="FNanchor14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14">[14]</a>. But those who gather it do this so
carefully that they receive no evil from it. If a man has a pain in
his head or in his body, or in his hand or foot, it can be cured by
this herb. If you take this plant and beat it and let the man drink
of it, he will fall asleep very softly, and no more will he feel
pain<a name="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15">[15]</a>. There
are two kinds of this plant,--male and female. The leaves of both
are beautiful. The leaf of the female is thick like that of the
wild lettuce.</p>

gem of gems, and is of great value to men and women. It gives
comfort to the heart and renders the limbs strong and sound. It

<h2>MARIE-HENRI BEYLE (STENDHAL)</h2>
<h3>(1783-1842)</h3>
<center>BY FREDERIC TABER COOPER</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-m.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>arie-Henri Beyle, French novelist and man of letters, who is
better known under his bizarre pseudonym of Stendhal, is a somewhat
unusual figure among French writers. He was curiously
misappreciated by his own generation, whose literary movements he
in turn confessedly ignored. He is recognized to-day as an
important link in the development of modern fiction, and is even
discussed concurrently with Balzac, in the same way that we speak
of Dickens and Thackeray, Emerson and Lowell.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-439.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Henri Beyle.</b></p>
<p>There is nothing dramatic in Stendhal's life, which, viewed
impartially, is a simple and somewhat pathetic record of failure
and disillusion. He was six years older than Balzac, having been
born January 23d, 1783, in the small town of Grenoble, in
Dauphin&eacute;, which, with its narrow prejudices and petty
formalism, seemed to him in after years "the souvenir of an
abominable indigestion." He early developed an abnormal
sensibility, which would have met with ready response had his
mother lived, but which a keen dread of ridicule taught him to hide
from an unsympathetic father and a still more unkind aunt,--later
his step-mother, S&eacute;raphie Gagnon. He seemed predestined to
be misunderstood--even his school companions finding him odd, and
often amusing themselves at his expense. Thus he grew up with a
sense of isolation in his own home, and when, in 1800, he had the
opportunity of going to some distant relatives in Paris, the Daru
family, he seized it eagerly. The following year he accompanied the
younger Darus to Italy, and was present at the battle of Marengo.
This was the turning-point of Stendhal's career. He was dazzled by
Napoleon's successes, and fascinated with the beauty and gayety of
Milan, where he found himself for the first time in a congenial
atmosphere, and among companions animated by a common cause. His
consequent sense of freedom and exaltation knew no bounds.
Henceforth Napoleon was to be his hero, and Italy the land of his
election; two lifelong passions which furnish the clew to much that
is enigmatic in his character.</p>
<p>During the ensuing years, while he followed the fortunes of
Napoleon throughout the Prussian campaign and until after the
retreat from Moscow, Italy was always present in his thoughts, and
when Waterloo ended his political and military aspirations he
hastened back to Milan, declaring that he "had ceased to be a
Frenchman," and settled down to a life of tranquil Bohemianism, too
absorbed in the paintings of Correggio and in the operas of Rossini
to be provident of the future. The following years, the happiest of
his life, were also the period of Stendhal's chief intellectual
growth,--due quite as much to the influence exerted on him by
Italian art and music as by his contact with men like Manzoni,
Monti, and Silvio Pellico. Unfortunately, his relations with
certain Italian patriots aroused the suspicions of the Austrian
police, and he was abruptly banished. He returned to Paris, where
to his surprise life proved more than tolerable, and where he made
many valuable acquaintances, such as Benjamin Constant, Destutt de
Tracy, and Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e. The revolution of July
brought him a change of fortune; for he was in sympathy with Louis
Philippe, and did not scruple to accept the consulship offered him
at Civit&agrave; Vecchia. He soon found, however, that a small
Mediterranean seaport was a poor substitute for his beloved Milan,
while its trying climate undoubtedly shortened his life. In 1841
failing health forced him to abandon his duties and return to
Paris, where he died of apoplexy on March 23d, 1842.</p>
<p>So much at least of Stendhal's life must be known in order to
understand his writings; all of which, not excepting the novels,
belong to what Ferdinand Bruneti&egrave;re stigmatizes as "personal
literature." Indeed, the chief interest of many of his books lies
in the side-lights they throw upon his curious personality. He was
a man of violent contrasts, a puzzle to his best friends; one day
making the retreat from Moscow with undaunted zeal, the next
settling down contentedly in Milan, to the very <i>vie de
caf&eacute;</i> he affected to despise. He was a strange
combination of restless energy and philosophic contemplation;
hampered by a morbid sensibility which tended to increase, but
which he flattered himself that he "had learned to hide under an
irony imperceptible to the vulgar," yet continually giving offense
to others by his caustic tongue. He seemed to need the tonic of
strong emotions, and was happiest when devoting himself heart and
soul to some person or cause, whether a Napoleon, a mistress, or a
question of philosophy. His great preoccupation was the analysis of
the human mind, an employment which in later years became a
positive detriment. He was often led to attribute ulterior motives
to his friends, a course which only served to render him morbid and
unjust; while his equally pitiless dissection of his own sensations
often robbed them of half their charm. Even love and war, his
favorite emotions, left him disillusioned, asking "Is that all it
amounts to?" He always had a profound respect for force of
character, regarding even lawlessness as preferable to apathy; but
he was implacable towards baseness or vulgarity. Herein lies,
perhaps, the chief reason for Stendhal's ill success in life; he
would never stoop to obsequiousness or flattery, and in avoiding
even the semblance of self-interest, allowed his fairest chances to
pass him by. "I have little regret for my lost opportunities," he
wrote in 1835. "In place of ten thousand, I might be getting
twenty; in place of Chevalier, I might be Officer of the Legion of
Honor: but I should have had to think three or four hours a day of
those platitudes of ambition which are dignified by the name of
politics; I should have had to commit many base acts:" a brief but
admirable epitome of Stendhal's whole life and character.</p>
<p>Aside from his works of fiction, Stendhal's works may be
conveniently grouped under biographies,--'Vie de Haydn, de Mozart,
et de Metastase,' 'Vie de Napol&eacute;on,' 'Vie de Rossini';
literary and artistic criticism,--'Histoire de la Peinture en
Italie,' 'Racine et Shakespeare,' 'M&eacute;langes d'Art et de
Litt&eacute;rature'; travels,--'Rome, Naples, et Florence,'
'Promenades dans Rome,' 'M&eacute;moires d'un Touriste'; and one
volume of sentimental psychology, his 'Essai sur l'Amour,' to which
Bourget owes the suggestion of his 'Physiologie de l'Amour
Moderne.' Many of these works merit greater popularity, being
written in an easy, fluent style, and relieved by his inexhaustible
fund of anecdote and personal reminiscence. His books of travel,
especially, are charming <i>causeries</i>, full of a sympathetic
spontaneity which more than atones for their lack of method; his
'Walks in Rome' is more readable than two-thirds of the books since
written on that subject.</p>
<p>Stendhal's present vogue, however, is due primarily to his
novels, to which he owes the almost literal fulfillment of his
prophecy that he would not be appreciated until 1880. Before that
date they had been comparatively neglected, in spite of Balzac's
spontaneous and enthusiastic tribute to the 'Chartreuse de Parme,'
and the appreciative criticisms of Taine and Prosper
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e. The truth is that Stendhal was in some ways
a generation behind his time, and often has an odd, old-fashioned
flavor suggestive of Marivaux and Cr&eacute;billon <i>fils</i>. On
the other hand, his psychologic tendency is distinctly modern, and
not at all to the taste of an age which found Chateaubriand or
Madame de Sta&euml;l eminently satisfactory. But he appeals
strongly to the speculating, self-questioning spirit of the present
day, and Zola and Bourget in turn have been glad to claim kinship
with him.</p>
<p>Stendhal, however, cannot be summarily labeled and dismissed as
a realist or psychologue in the modern acceptation of the term,
although he was a pioneer in both fields. He had a sovereign
contempt for literary style or method, and little dreamed that he
would one day be regarded as the founder of a school. It must be
remembered that he was a soldier before he was a man of letters,
and his love of adventure occasionally got the better of his love
of logic, making his novels a curious mixture of convincing truth
and wild romanticism. His heroes are singularly like himself, a
mixture of morbid introspection and restless energy: he seems to
have taken special pleasure in making them succeed where he had
failed in life, and when the spirit of the story-teller gets the
better of the psychologist, he sends them on a career of adventure
which puts to shame Dumas <i>p&egrave;re</i> or Walter Scott. And
yet Stendhal was a born analyst, a self-styled "observer of the
human heart"; and the real merit of his novels lies in the
marvelous fidelity with which he interprets the emotions, showing
the inner workings of his hero's mind from day to day, and
multiplying petty details with convincing logic. But in his
preoccupation for mental conditions he is apt to lose sight of the
material side of life, and the symmetry of his novels is marred by
a meagreness of physical detail and a lack of atmosphere. Zola has
laid his finger upon Stendhal's real weakness when he points out
that "the landscape, the climate, the time of day, the
weather,.--Nature herself, in other words,--never seems to
intervene and exert an influence on his characters"; and he cites a
passage which in point of fact admirably illustrates his meaning,
the scene from the 'Rouge et Noir', where Julien endeavors to take
the hand of Mme. de R&ecirc;nal, which he characterizes as "a
little mute drama of great power," adding in conclusion:--"Give
that episode to an author for whom the <i>milieu</i> exists, and he
will make the night, with its odors, its voices, its soft
voluptuousness, play a part in the defeat of the woman. And that
author will be in the right; his picture will be more complete." It
is this tendency to leave nature out of consideration which gives
Stendhal's characters a flavor of abstraction, and caused
Sainte-Beuve to declare in disgust that they were "not human
beings, but ingeniously constructed automatons." Yet it is unfair
to conclude with Zola, that Stendhal was a man for whom the outside
world did not exist; he was not insensible to the beauties of
nature, only he looked upon them as a secondary consideration.
After a sympathetic description of the Rhone valley, he had to add,
"But the interest of a landscape is insufficient; in the long run,
some moral or historical interest is indispensable." Yet he
recognized explicitly the influence of climate and environment upon
character, and seems to have been sensible of his own shortcomings
as an author. "I abhor material descriptions," he confesses in
'Souvenirs d'&Eacute;gotisme': "the <i>ennui</i> of making them
deters me from writing novels."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, aside from his short 'Chroniques' and 'Nouvelles,'
and the posthumous 'Lamiel' which he probably intended to destroy,
Stendhal has left four stories which deserve detailed
consideration: 'Armance,' 'Le Rouge et Le Noir,' 'La Chartreuse de
Parme,' and the fragmentary novel 'Lucien Leuwen.'</p>
<p>As has been justly pointed out by Stendhal's sympathetic
biographer, Edouard Rod, the heroes of the four books are
essentially of one type, and all more or less faithful copies of
himself; having in common a need of activity, a thirst for love, a
keen sensibility, and an unbounded admiration for Napoleon--and
differing only by reason of the several <i>milieus</i> in which he
has placed them. The first of these, 'Armance,' appeared in 1827.
The hero, Octave, is an aristocrat, son of the Marquis de Malivert,
who "was very rich before the Revolution, and when he returned to
Paris in 1814, thought himself beggared on an income of twenty or
thirty thousand." Octave is the most exaggerated of all Stendhal's
heroes; a mysterious, sombre being, "a misanthrope before his
time"; coupling with his pride of birth a consciousness of its
vanity:--"Had heaven made me the son of a manufacturer of cloth, I
should have worked at my desk from the age of sixteen, while now my
sole occupation has been luxury. I should have had less pride and
more happiness. Ah, how I despise myself!" Yet it is part of
Octave's pretensions to regard himself as superior to love. When he
discovers his passion for his cousin Armance, he is overwhelmed
with despair: "I am in love," he said in a choked voice. "I, in
love! Great God!" The object of this reluctant passion, Armance de
Zohiloff, is a poor orphan, dependent upon a rich relative. Like
Octave, she struggles against her affection, but for better
reasons: "The world will look upon me as a lady's-maid who has
entrapped the son of the family." The history of their long and
secret struggle against this growing passion, complicated by
outside incidents and intrigues, forms the bulk of the volume. At
last Octave is wounded in a duel, and moved by the belief that he
is dying, they mutually confess their affection. Octave
unexpectedly recovers, and as Armance about this time receives an
inheritance from a distant relative, the story promises to end
happily; but at the last moment he is induced to credit a calumny
against her, and commits suicide, when Armance retires to a
convent. The book is distinctly inferior to his later efforts, and
M. Rod is the first to find hidden beauties in it.</p>
<p>Very different was his next book, 'Le Rouge et Le Noir,' the
Army and the Priesthood, which appeared in 1830, and is now
recognized as Stendhal's masterpiece. As its singular name is
intended to imply, it deals with the changed social conditions
which confronted the young men of France after the downfall of
Napoleon,--the reaction against war and military glory in favor of
the Church; a topic which greatly occupied Stendhal, and which is
well summed up in the words of his hero Julien:--"When Bonaparte
made himself talked about, France was afraid of invasion; military
merit was necessary and fashionable. Today one sees priests of
forty with appointments of a hundred thousand francs, three times
that of Napoleon's famous generals;" and he concludes, "The thing
to do is to be a priest."</p>
<p>This Julien Sorel is the son of a shrewd but ignorant peasant,
owner of a prosperous saw-mill in the small town of
Verri&egrave;res, in Franche-Comt&eacute;. "He was a small young
man, of feeble appearance, with irregular but delicate features,
and an aquiline nose; ... who could have divined that that girlish
face, so pale, and gentle, hid an indomitable resolution to expose
himself to a thousand deaths sooner than not make his fortune?" His
only schooling is gained from a cousin, an old army surgeon, who
taught him Latin and inflamed his fancy with stories of Napoleon,
and from the aged Abb&eacute; Ch&eacute;lan who grounds him in
theology,--for Julien had proclaimed his intention of studying for
the priesthood. By unexpected good luck, his Latin earned him an
appointment as tutor to the children of M. de R&ecirc;nal, the
pompous and purse-proud Mayor of Verri&egrave;res. Julien is
haunted by his peculiar notions of duties which he owes it to
himself to perform as steps towards his worldly advancement; for
circumstances have made him a consummate hypocrite. One of these
duties is to make love to Mme. de R&ecirc;nal: "Why should he not
be loved as Bonaparte, while still poor, had been loved by the
brilliant Mme. de Beauharnais?" His pursuit of the Mayor's gentle
and inexperienced wife proves only too successful, but at last
reaches the ears of the Abb&eacute; Ch&eacute;lan, whose influence
compels Julien to leave Verri&egrave;res and go to the Seminary at
Besan&ccedil;on, to finish his theological studies. His stay at the
Seminary was full of disappointment, for "it was in vain that he
made himself small and insignificant, he could not please: he was
too different." At last he has a chance to go to Paris, as
secretary to the influential Marquis de La Mole, who interests
himself in Julien and endeavors to advance him socially. The
Marquis has a daughter, Mathilde, a female counterpart of
Stendhal's heroes; with exalted ideas of duty, and a profound
reverence for Marguerite of Navarre, who dared to ask the
executioner for the head of her lover, Boniface de La Mole,
executed April 30th, 1574. Mathilde always assumed mourning on
April 30th. "I know of nothing," she declared, "except condemnation
to death, which distinguishes a man: it is the only thing which
cannot be bought." Julien soon conceives it his duty to win
Mathilde's affections, and the love passages which ensue between
these two "&eacute;sprits sup&eacute;rieurs" are singular in the
extreme: they arrive at love only through a complicated
intellectual process, in which the question of duty, either to
themselves or to each other, is always paramount. At last it
becomes necessary to confess their affection to the Marquis, who is
naturally furious. "For the first time in his life this nobleman
forgot his manners: he overwhelmed him with atrocious insults,
worthy of a cab-driver. Perhaps the novelty of these oaths was a
distraction." What hurts him most is that Mathilde will be plain
Mme. Sorel and not a duchess. But at this juncture the father
receives a letter from Mme. de R&ecirc;nal, telling of her
relations with Julien, and accusing him of having deliberately won
Mathilde in order to possess her wealth. Such baseness the Marquis
cannot pardon, and at any cost he forbids the marriage. Julien
returns immediately to Verri&egrave;res, and finding Mme. de
R&ecirc;nal in church, deliberately shoots her. She ultimately
recovers from her wound, but Julien is nevertheless condemned and
guillotined. Mme. de R&ecirc;nal dies of remorse, while Mathilde,
emulating Marguerite de Navarre, buries Julien's head with her own
hands.</p>
<p>The 'Chartreuse de Parme,' although written the same year as the
'Rouge et Noir', was not published until 1839, two years before his
death, and was judged his best effort. "He has written 'The Modern
Prince,'" declared Balzac, "the book which Macchiavelli would have
written if he had been living exiled from Italy in the nineteenth
century." The action takes place at Parma; and as a picture of
court life in a small Italian principality, with all its jealousies
and intrigues, the book is certainly a masterpiece. But it is
marred by the extravagance of its plot. The hero, Fabrice, is the
younger son of a proud and bigoted Milanese nobleman, the Marquis
del Dongo, who "joined a sordid avarice to a host of other fine
qualities," and in his devotion to the House of Austria was
implacable towards Napoleon. Fabrice, however, was "a young man
susceptible of enthusiasm," and on learning of Napoleon's return
from Elba, hastened secretly to join him, and participated in the
battle of Waterloo. This escapade is denounced by his father to the
Austrian police, and on his return Fabrice is forced to take refuge
in Swiss territory. About this time his aunt Gina, the beautiful
Countess Pietranera, goes to live at Parma; and to conceal a love
affair with the prime minister Mosca marries the old Duke of
Sanseverina-Taxis, who obligingly leaves on his wedding-day for a
distant embassy. Gina has always felt a strong interest for
Fabrice, which later ripens into a passion. It is agreed that
Fabrice shall study for the priesthood, and that Count Mosca will
use his influence to have him made Archbishop of Parma, an office
frequently held in the past by Del Dongos. Unfortunately Fabrice is
drawn into a quarrel with a certain Giletti, a low comedy actor,
whom he kills in self-defense. Ordinarily the killing of a fellow
of Giletti's stamp by a Del Dongo would have been considered a
trifling matter; but this offense assumes importance through the
efforts of a certain political faction to discredit the minister
through his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The situation is further
complicated by the Prince, Ernest IV., who has come under the spell
of Gina's beauty, and furious at finding her obdurate, is glad of
an opportunity to humiliate her. Fabrice is condemned to ten years'
imprisonment in the Farnese tower, the Prince treacherously
disregarding his promise of pardon. From this point the plot
becomes fantastic. From his window in the tower, Fabrice overlooks
that of Cl&eacute;lia, daughter of General Fabio Conti, governor of
the prison. It is a case of mutual love at first sight, and for
months the two hold communication by signs above the heads of the
passing sentries. After his fabulous escape, effected by the help
of his aunt, Fabrice is inconsolable, and at length returns
voluntarily to the tower in order to be near Cl&eacute;lia. It is
not until after the death of the Prince that the Duchess obtains
Fabrice's pardon from his son and successor. At last Cl&eacute;lia
dies, and Fabrice enters the neighboring monastery, the Chartreuse
of Parma.</p>
<p>Fabrice's experiences on the battle-field of Waterloo, where as
a raw youth he first "smelled powder," are recounted with a good
deal of realistic detail. They suggest a comparison with a book of
more recent date devoted to a similar subject, Stephen Crane's 'Red
Badge of Courage,' though of course the latter does not approach
Stendhal in artistic self-restraint and mastery over form.</p>
<p>The remaining novel, 'Lucien Leuwen,' was left in an unfinished
state, and thus published after the author's death, under the title
of 'Le Chasseur Vert.' Recently they have been republished, under
the name of 'Lucien Leuwen,' with additional material which the
editor, M. Jean de Mitty, claims to have deciphered from almost
illegible manuscripts found in the library at Grenoble. But even
without these additions there is enough to show that 'Lucien
Leuwen' would have been one of his best efforts, second only,
perhaps, to the 'Rouge et Noir.' The hero, Lucien, is the son of a
rich financier, who "was never out of temper and never took a
serious tone with his son," but cheerfully paid his debts, saying
"A son is a creditor provided by nature." Out of mere <i>ennui</i>
from lack of serious employment, Lucien enters as sub-lieutenant a
regiment of Lancers in garrison at Nancy. He has no illusions about
military life in times of peace:--"I shall wage war only upon
cigars; I shall become the pillager of a military caf&eacute; in
the gloomy garrison of an ill-paved little town.... What glory! My
soul will be well caught when I present myself to Napoleon in the
next world. 'No doubt,' he will say, 'you were dying of hunger when
you took up this life?' 'No, General,' I shall reply, 'I thought I
was imitating you.'" His early experiences at Nancy, his subsequent
meeting with and love for Mme. de Chasteller, are admirable equally
for their moderation and their fidelity.</p>
<p>Since Stendhalism has become a cult, so much has been written on
the subject that a complete bibliography of Stendhaliana would
occupy several pages. Aside from the well-known criticisms of
Balzac, Taine, and Sainte-Beuve, the most important contributions
to the subject are the article by Zola in 'Romanciers
Naturalistes,' that by Bourget in 'Essais de Psychologie
Contemporaine,' and the biography by Edouard Rod in the 'Grands
&Eacute;crivains Fran&ccedil;ais' (Great French Writers) Series.
Thanks to the zeal of M. Casimir Stryienski, a considerable amount
of autobiographical material has lately been brought to light:
'Journal de Stendhal' 'Vie de Henri Broulard,' and 'Souvenirs
d'&Eacute;gotisme,' which, together with his 'Correspondence,' are
indispensable for a true knowledge of the man.</p>

<center><b>PRINCESS SANSEVERINA'S INTERVIEW</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'La Chartreuse de Parme'</center>
<br>
<p>While Fabrice was gone a-hunting after love adventures in a
small village close by Parma, the Fiscal General, Rassi, unaware
that he was so near, continued to treat his case as though he had
been a Liberal. The witnesses for the defense he pretended that he
could not find, or rather that he had frightened them off; and
finally, after nearly a year of such sharp practice, and about two
months after Fabrice's last return to Bologna, on a certain Friday,
the Marquise Raversi, intoxicated with joy, stated publicly in her
salon that on the following day "the sentence which had just been
passed upon that little Del Dongo would be presented to the Prince
for signature, and would be approved by him." Shortly afterwards
the Duchess learned these remarks of her enemy.</p>
<p>"The Count must be very poorly served by his agents," she said
to herself: "only this morning he was sure that sentence could not
be passed inside of a week: perhaps he would not be sorry to have
my young Grand Vicar removed from Parma some day. But," she added,
"we shall see him come back, and he shall be our Archbishop." The
Duchess rang.</p>
<p>"Summon all the servants to the waiting-room," she said to her
valet-de-chambre, "even the cooks; go and obtain from the officer
in command the requisite permit for four post-horses; and see that
in less than half an hour these horses are attached to my landau."
All her women were soon busied in packing the trunks: the Duchess
hastily donned a traveling dress, without once sending word to the
Count; the idea of amusing herself at his expense filled her with
joy.</p>
<p>"My friend," she said to the assembled servants, "is about to
suffer condemnation by default for having had the audacity to
defend his life against a madman; it was Giletti who meant to kill
him. You have all been able to see how gentle and inoffensive
Fabrice's character is. Justly incensed at this atrocious injury, I
am starting for Florence. I shall leave ten years' wages for each
of you; if you are unhappy, write to me; and so long as I have a
sequin, there shall be something for you."</p>
<p>The Duchess felt exactly as she spoke, and at her last words the
servants burst into tears; she herself had moist eyes. She added in
a voice of emotion:--"Pray to God for me and for Monsigneur Fabrice
del Dongo, first Grand Vicar of this Diocese, who will be condemned
to-morrow morning to the galleys, or what would be less stupid, to
the penalty of death."</p>
<p>The tears of the servants redoubled, and little by little
changed into cries which were very nearly seditious. The Duchess
entered her carriage and drove directly to the palace of the
Prince. In spite of the untimely hour, she solicited an audience,
through General Fontana, acting aide-de-camp. She was nowise in
full court toilette, a fact which threw that aide-de-camp into a
profound stupor.</p>
<p>The Prince, for his part, was by no means surprised, still less
annoyed, at this request for an audience. "We are going to see
tears shed by lovely eyes," said he, rubbing his hands; "she is
coming to ask for grace; at last that proud beauty has to humble
herself! Really she has been too insupportable with her little
independent airs! Those eloquent eyes always seemed to be saying to
me, at the least thing which annoyed her, 'Naples or Milan would be
an abode offering very different attractions from those of your
small town of Parma.' True enough, I do not reign over Naples or
Milan; but all the same, this fine lady has come to ask me
something which depends exclusively upon me, and which she is
burning to obtain. I always thought the coming of that nephew would
give me some hold upon her."</p>
<p>While the Prince was smiling over his thoughts, and giving
himself up to all these agreeable anticipations, he was striding up
and down his cabinet, at the door of which General Fontana still
remained standing, erect and stiff as a soldier at carry-arms.
Seeing the Prince's flashing eye and recalling the Duchess's
traveling dress, he prepared for a dissolution of the monarchy. His
confusion knew no bounds when he heard the Prince's order: "Beg
Madame the Duchess to wait a small quarter of an hour." The
general-aide-de-camp executed a right-about-face, like a soldier on
parade; the Prince still smiled. "Fontana is not accustomed," he
said to himself, "to see our proud Duchess kept waiting. The
astonished face with which he has gone to tell her 'to wait that
small quarter of an hour' will pave the way for those touching
tears which this cabinet is about to witness." This small quarter
of an hour was delicious to the Prince; he paced the floor with a
firm and measured step, he <i>reigned</i>. "The important thing now
is to say nothing which is not perfectly in keeping. It will not do
to forget that she is one of the highest ladies of my court. How
would Louis XIV. have spoken to the princesses his daughters when
he had occasion to be displeased with them?" and his eyes sought
the portrait of the great king.</p>
<p>The amusing part of the matter was that the Prince did not even
think of asking himself whether he would show clemency to Fabrice,
and how far such clemency would go. Finally, at the end of twenty
minutes, the faithful Fontana presented himself anew at the door,
but without uttering a word. "The Duchess Sanseverina may enter,"
cried the Prince with a theatrical air. "The tears are about to
commence," he told himself, and as if to be prepared for such a
spectacle, he drew out his handkerchief.</p>
<p>Never had the Duchess appeared so gay and charming; she did not
look twenty-five. The poor aide-de-camp, seeing that her light and
rapid footstep barely seemed to skim the carpet, was on the point
of losing his reason once for all.</p>
<p>"I must crave many pardons of your Most Serene Highness," said
the Duchess in her soft tones of careless gayety: "I have taken the
liberty of presenting myself in a toilette which is not altogether
appropriate; but your Highness has so accustomed me to his favors
that I have ventured to hope that he would accord me this
additional grace."</p>
<p>The Duchess spoke quite slowly, so as to give herself time to
enjoy the expression of the Prince. It was delicious, on account of
his profound astonishment, and that remnant of grand airs which the
pose of his head and arms still betrayed. The Prince had remained
as if struck by a thunderbolt; from time to time, he exclaimed, in
his high-pitched voice, shrill and perturbed, as though
articulating with difficulty: <i>"How is this? how is this?"</i>
After concluding her compliment, the Duchess, as though from
respect, afforded him ample time to reply; then she added:--</p>
<p>"I venture to hope that your Most Serene Highness will deign to
pardon the incongruity of my costume:" but as she spoke, her
mocking eyes flashed with so bright a gleam that the Prince could
not meet them. He looked at the ceiling, a sign with him of the
most extreme embarrassment.</p>
<p>"How is this? how is this?" he said to himself again; then by
good luck, he found a phrase: "Madame la Duchesse, pray be seated,"
and he himself pushed forward a chair, with fairly good grace. The
Duchess was by no means insensible to this attention, and she
moderated the petulance of her glance.</p>
<p>"How is this? how is this?" still repeated the Prince inwardly,
shifting so uneasily in his chair that one would have said that he
could not find a secure position.</p>
<p>"I am going to take advantage of the freshness of the night to
travel post," resumed the Duchess, "and as my absence may be of
some duration, I was unwilling to leave the territory of your Most
Serene Highness without expressing my thanks for all the favors
which for five years your Highness has deigned to show me." At
these words the Prince at last understood; he turned pale. It was
as man of the world that he felt it most keenly, on finding himself
mistaken in his predictions. Then he assumed a grand air, in every
way worthy of the portrait of Louis XIV., which was before his
eyes. "Admirable," said the Duchess to herself, "there is a
man."</p>
<p>"And what is the motive of this sudden departure?" asked the
Prince, in a fairly firm tone.</p>
<p>"I have contemplated leaving, for some time," replied the
Duchess, "and a slight insult which has been shown to
<i>Monsignor</i> del Dongo, who is to be condemned to-morrow to
death or to the galleys makes me hasten my departure."</p>
<p>"And to what city are you going?"</p>
<p>"To Naples, I think." As she arose, she added, "It only remains
for me to take leave of your Most Serene Highness, and to thank him
very humbly for all his <i>earlier</i> kindnesses." She, on her
part, spoke with so firm an air that the Prince saw clearly that in
a few seconds all would be finished. He knew that if a triumphant
departure was once effected, all compromise would be impossible.
She was not the woman to retrace her steps. He hastened after
her.</p>
<p>"But you know very well, Madame la Duchesse," he said, taking
her hand, "that I have always regarded you with a friendship to
which it needed only a word from you to give another name. But a
murder has been committed; there is no way of denying that. I have
intrusted the conduct of the case to my best judges ..."</p>
<p>At these words the Duchess drew herself up to her full height:
All semblance of respect, or even of urbanity, disappeared in a
flash. The outraged woman was clearly revealed, the outraged woman
addressing herself to the one whom she knows to be of bad faith. It
was with an expression of keenest anger and even of contempt that
she said to the Prince, dwelling upon every word:--</p>
<p>"I am leaving forever the States of your Most Serene Highness,
in order that I shall never again hear mentioned the Fiscal Rassi,
or the other infamous assassins who have condemned my nephew and so
many others to death. If your Most Serene Highness does not wish to
mingle a tinge of bitterness with the last moments which I am to
pass with a prince who is both polite and entertaining when he is
not misled, I beg him very humbly not to recall the thought of
those infamous judges who sell themselves for a thousand crowns or
a decoration."</p>
<p>The admirable accent, and above all the tone of sincerity, with
which these words were uttered, made the Prince tremble; for an
instant he feared to see his dignity compromised by a still more
direct accusation. On the whole, however, his sensations quickly
culminated in one of pleasure. He admired the Duchess, and at this
moment her entire person attained a sublime beauty.</p>
<p>"Heavens! how beautiful she is," the Prince said to himself:
"one may well overlook something in so unique a woman, one whose
like perhaps is not to be found in all Italy.--Well, with a little
diplomacy it might not be altogether impossible to make her
mine.--There is a wide difference between such a being and that
doll of a Marquise Balbi; besides, the latter steals at least three
hundred thousand francs a year from my poor subjects.--But did I
understand her aright?" he thought all of a sudden: "she said,
'condemned my nephew and so many others.'" His anger came to the
surface, and it was with a haughtiness worthy of supreme rank that
the Prince said, "And what must be done to keep Madame from
leaving?"</p>
<p>"Something of which you are not capable," replied the Duchess,
with an accent of the bitterest irony and the most thinly disguised
contempt.</p>
<p>The Prince was beside himself, but thanks to his long practice
of the profession of absolute sovereign, he found the strength to
resist his first impulse. "That woman must be mine," he said to
himself. "I owe myself at least that; then I must let her perish
under my contempt. If she leaves this room, I shall never see her
again." But, intoxicated as he was at this moment with wrath and
hatred, how was he to find words which would at once satisfy what
was due to himself and induce the Duchess not to desert his court
on the instant? "A gesture," he thought, "is something which can
neither be repeated nor turned into ridicule," and he went and
placed himself between the Duchess and the door of his cabinet.
Just then he heard a slight tapping at this door.</p>
<p>"Who is this jackanapes?" he cried, at the top of his lungs,
"who is this jackanapes who comes here, thrusting his idiotic
presence upon me?" Poor General Fontana showed his face, pale and
in evident discomfiture, and with the air of a man at his last
gasp, indistinctly pronounced these words:--"His Excellency Count
Mosca solicits the honor of being admitted."</p>
<p>"Let him enter," said the Prince in a loud voice; and as Mosca
made his salutation, greeted him with:--</p>
<p>"Well, sir, here is Madame the Duchess Sanseverina, who declares
that she is on the point of leaving Parma to go and settle at
Naples, and has made me saucy speeches into the bargain."</p>
<p>"How is this?" said Mosca, turning pale.</p>
<p>"What, then you knew nothing of this project of departure?"</p>
<p>"Not the first word. At six o'clock I left Madame joyous and
contented."</p>
<p>This speech produced an incredible effect upon the Prince. First
he glanced at Mosca, whose growing pallor proved that he spoke the
truth and was in no way the accomplice of the Duchess's sudden
freak. "In that case," he said to himself, "I am losing her
forever. Pleasure and vengeance, everything is escaping me at once.
At Naples she will make epigrams with her nephew Fabrice, about the
great wrath of the little Prince of Parma." He looked at the
Duchess; anger and the most violent contempt were struggling in her
heart; her eyes were fixed at that moment upon Count Mosca, and the
fine lines of that lovely mouth expressed the most bitter disdain.
The entire expression of her face seemed to say, "Vile courtier!"
"So," thought the Prince, after having examined her, "I have lost
even this means of calling her back to our country. If she leaves
the room at this moment, she is lost to me. And the Lord only knows
what she will say in Naples of my judges, and with that wit and
divine power of persuasion with which heaven has endowed her, she
will make the whole world believe her. I shall owe her the
reputation of being a ridiculous tyrant, who gets up in the middle
of the night to look under his bed!"</p>
<p>Then, by an adroit movement, and as if striving to work off his
agitation by striding up and down, the Prince placed himself anew
before the door of his cabinet. The count was on his right, pale,
unnerved, and trembling so that he had to lean for support upon the
back of the chair which the Duchess had occupied at the beginning
of the audience, and which the Prince, in a moment of wrath, had
hurled to a distance. The Count was really in love. "If the Duchess
goes away, I shall follow her," he told himself; "but will she
tolerate my company? that is the question."</p>
<p>On the left of the Prince stood the Duchess, her arms crossed
and pressed against her breast, looking at him with superb
intolerance; a complete and profound pallor had succeeded the
glowing colors which just before had animated those exquisite
features.</p>
<p>The Prince, in contrast with both the others, had a high color
and an uneasy air; his left hand played in a nervous fashion with
the cross attached to the grand cordon of his order, which he wore
beneath his coat; with his right hand he caressed his chin.</p>
<p>"What is to be done?" he said to the Count, not altogether
realizing what he was doing himself, but yielding to his habit of
consulting the latter about everything.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Most Serene Highness, I know nothing about it,"
answered the Count, with the air of a man who is rendering up his
final sigh; he could hardly utter the words of his response. His
tone of voice gave the Prince the first consolation which his
wounded pride had found during the interview, and this slight
satisfaction helped him to a phrase which was comforting to his
self-esteem:--</p>
<p>"Well," said he, "I am the most reasonable of all three; I am
quite ready to leave my position in the world entirely out of
consideration. <i>I am going to speak as a friend</i>," and he
added with a charming smile of condescension, a fine imitation of
the happy times of Louis XIV, "<i>as a friend speaking to
friends:</i> Madame la Duchesse," he continued, "what are we to do
to make you forget your untimely resolution?"</p>
<p>"Really, I am at a loss to say," replied the Duchess, with a
deep sigh, "really, I am at a loss to say: I have such a horror of
Parma!" There was no attempt at epigram in this speech; one could
see that she spoke in all sincerity.</p>
<p>The Count turned sharply away from her; his courtier's soul was
scandalized. Then he cast a supplicating glance at the Prince. With
much dignity and self-possession the latter allowed a moment to
pass; then, addressing himself to the Count, "I see," said he,
"that your charming friend is altogether beside herself. It is
perfectly simple, she <i>adores</i> her nephew;" and turning
towards the Duchess, he added with the most gallant glance, and at
the same time with the air which one assumes in borrowing a phrase
from a comedy: <i>"What must we do to find favor in these lovely
eyes?"</i></p>
<p>The Duchess had had time to reflect: She answered in a firm,
slow tone, as if she were dictating her ultimatum:--</p>
<p>"His Highness might write me a gracious letter, such as he knows
so well how to write: he might say to me, that being by no means
convinced of the guilt of Fabrice del Dongo, First Grand Vicar of
the Archbishop, he will refuse to sign the sentence when they come
to present it to him, and that this unjust procedure shall have no
consequence in the future."</p>
<p>"How is that? Unjust!" cried the Prince, coloring to the whites
of his eyes, and with renewed anger.</p>
<p>"That is not all," replied the Duchess with truly Roman pride,
"<i>this very evening</i>--and," she interposed, glancing at the
clock, "it is already a quarter past eleven--this very evening, his
Most Serene Highness will send word to the Marquise Raversi that he
advises her to go into the country to recuperate from the fatigues
which she must have suffered from a certain trial which she was
discussing in her salon early in the evening." The Prince strode up
and down his cabinet, like a madman. "Did one ever see such a
woman?" he exclaimed. "She is lacking in respect for me."</p>
<p>The Duchess replied with perfect grace:--</p>
<p>"I have never in my life dreamed of lacking respect for his Most
Serene Highness; His Highness has had the extreme condescension to
say that he was speaking <i>as a friend to friends</i>. What is
more, I have not the smallest desire to remain in Parma," she
added, glancing at the Count with the last degree of contempt. This
glance decided the Prince, who up to that moment had been quite
uncertain, notwithstanding that his words had seemed to imply a
promise; he had a fine contempt for words.</p>
<p>There were still a few more words exchanged; but at last Count
Mosca received the order to write the gracious note solicited by
the Duchess. He omitted the phrase "this unjust procedure shall
have no consequence in the future." "It is sufficient," said the
Count to himself, "if the Prince promises not to sign the sentence
which is to be presented to him." The Prince thanked him by a
glance, as he signed.</p>
<p>The Count made a great mistake; the Prince was wearied and would
have signed the whole. He thought that he was getting out of the
scene well, and the whole affair was dominated, in his eyes, by the
thought--"If the Duchess leaves, I shall find my court a bore
inside of a week." The Count observed that his master corrected the
date, and substituted that of the next day. He looked at the clock;
it indicated almost midnight. The minister saw, in this altered
date, nothing more than a pedantic desire to afford proof of
exactitude and good government. As to the exile of the Marquise
Raversi, the Prince did not even frown; the Prince had a special
weakness for exiling people.</p>
<p>"General Fontana!" he cried, half opening the door.</p>
<p>The General appeared, with such an astonished and curious a face
that a glance of amusement passed between the Duchess and the
Count, and this glance established peace.</p>
<p>"General Fontana," said the Prince, "you are to take my
carriage, which is waiting under the colonnade; you will go to the
house of Mme. Raversi, and have yourself announced: if she is in
bed, you will add that you are my representative, and when admitted
to her chamber, you will say precisely these words, and no
others:--'Mme. la Marquise Raversi, his Most Serene Highness
requires that you shall depart before eight o'clock to-morrow
morning, for your chateau of Valleja. His Highness will notify you
when you may return to Parma.'"</p>
<p>The Prince's eyes sought those of the Duchess, but the latter,
omitting the thanks which he had expected, made him an extremely
respectful reverence, and rapidly left the room.</p>
<p>"What a woman!" said the Prince, turning towards Count
Mosca.</p>

<center><b>CL&Eacute;LIA AIDS FABRICE TO ESCAPE</b></center>
<br>
<center>From "La Chartreuse de Parme"</center>
<br>
<p>One day--Fabrice had been a captive nearly three months, had had
absolutely no communication with the outside world, and yet was not
unhappy--Grillo had remained hanging about the cell until a late
hour of the morning. Fabrice could think of no way of getting rid
of him, and was on pins and needles; half-past twelve had struck
when at last he was enabled to open the little trap in the hateful
shutter.</p>
<p>Cl&eacute;lia was standing at the window of the aviary in an
expectant attitude, an expression of profound despair on her
contracted features. As soon as she saw Fabrice she signaled to him
that all was lost; then, hurrying to her piano, and adapting her
words to the accompaniment of a recitative from a favorite opera,
in accents tremulous with her emotion and the fear of being
overheard by the sentry beneath, she sang:--</p>
<p>"Ah, do I see you still alive? Praise God for his infinite
mercy! Barbone, the wretch whose insolence you chastised the day of
your arrival here, disappeared some time ago and for a few days was
not seen about the citadel. He returned day before yesterday, and
since then I have reason to fear he has a design of poisoning you.
He has been seen prowling about the kitchen of the palace where
your meals are prepared. I can assert nothing positively, but it is
my maid's belief that his skulking there bodes you no good. I was
frightened this morning, not seeing you at the usual time; I
thought you must be dead. Until you hear more from me, do not touch
the food they give you; I will try to manage to convey a little
chocolate to you. In any case, if you have a cord, or can make one
from your linen, let it down from your window among the
orange-trees this evening at nine o'clock. I will attach a stronger
cord to it, and with its aid you can draw up the bread and
chocolate I will have in readiness."</p>
<p>Fabrice had carefully preserved the bit of charcoal he had found
in the stove; taking advantage of Cl&eacute;lia's more softened
mood, he formed on the palm of his hand a number of letters in
succession, which taken together made up these words:--</p>
<p>"I love you, and life is dear to me only when I can see you.
Above all else, send me paper and a pencil."</p>
<p>As Fabrice had hoped and expected, the extreme terror visible in
the young girl's face operated to prevent her from terminating the
interview on receipt of this audacious message; she only testified
her displeasure by her looks. Fabrice had the prudence to
add:--"The wind blows so hard to-day that I couldn't catch quite
all you said; and then, too, the sound of the piano drowns your
voice. You were saying something about poison, weren't you--what
was it?"</p>
<p>At these words the young girl's terror returned in all its
violence; she hurriedly set to work to describe with ink a number
of large capital letters on the leaves she tore from one of her
books, and Fabrice was delighted to see her at last adopt the
method of correspondence that he had been vainly advocating for the
last three months. But this system, although an improvement on the
signals, was less desirable than a regular exchange of letters, so
Fabrice constantly feigned to be unable to decipher the words of
which she exhibited the component letters.</p>
<p>A summons from her father obliged her to leave the aviary. She
was in great alarm lest he might come to look for her there; his
suspicious nature would have been likely to scent danger in the
proximity of his daughter's window to the prisoner's. It had
occurred to Cl&eacute;lia a short time before, while so anxiously
awaiting Fabrice's appearance, that pebbles might be made factors
in their correspondence, by wrapping the paper on which the message
was written round them and throwing them up so they should fall
within the open upper portion of the screen. The device would have
worked well unless Fabrice's keeper chanced to be in the room at
the time.</p>
<p>Our prisoner proceeded to tear one of his shirts into narrow
strips, forming a sort of ribbon. Shortly after nine o'clock that
evening he heard a tapping on the boxes of the orange-trees under
his window; he cautiously lowered his ribbon, and on drawing it up
again found attached to its free end a long cord by means of which
he hauled up a supply of chocolate, and, to his inexpressible
satisfaction, a package of note-paper and a pencil. He dropped the
cord again, but to no purpose; perhaps the sentries on their rounds
had approached the orange-trees. But his delight was sufficient for
one evening. He sat down and wrote a long letter to Cl&eacute;lia;
scarcely was it ended when he fastened it to the cord and let it
down. For more than three hours he waited in vain for some one to
come and take it; two or three times he drew it up and made
alterations in it. "If Cl&eacute;lia does not get my letter
to-night," he said to himself, "while those ideas of poison are
troubling her brain, it is more than likely that to-morrow she will
refuse to receive it."</p>
<p>The fact was that Cl&eacute;lia had been obliged to drive to the
city with her father. Fabrice knew how matters stood when he heard
the General's carriage enter the court about half-past twelve; he
knew it was the General's carriage by the horses' step. What was
his delight when, shortly after hearing the jingle of the General's
spurs as he crossed the esplanade, and the rattle of muskets as the
sentries presented arms, he felt a gentle tug at the cord, the end
of which he had kept wrapped around his wrist! Something heavy was
made fast to the cord; two little jerks notified him to haul up. He
had some difficulty in landing the object over a cornice that
projected under his window.</p>
<p>The article that he had secured at expense of so much trouble
proved to be a carafe of water wrapped in a shawl. The poor young
man, who had been living for so long a time in such complete
solitude, covered the shawl with rapturous kisses. But words are
inadequate to express his emotion when, after so many days of vain
waiting, he discovered a scrap of paper pinned to the shawl.</p>
<p>"Drink no water but this; satisfy your hunger with chocolate,"
said this precious missive. "To-morrow I will try to get some bread
to you; I will mark the crust at top and bottom with little crosses
made with ink. It is a frightful thing to say, but you must know
it:--I believe others are implicated in Barbone's design to poison
you. Could you not have understood that the subject you spoke of in
your letter in pencil is displeasing to me? I should not think of
writing to you were it not for the great peril that is hanging over
us. I have seen the Duchess; she is well, as is the Count, but she
is very thin. Write no more on that subject which you know of:
would you wish to make me angry?"</p>
<p>It cost Cl&eacute;lia an effort to write the last sentence but
one of the above note. It was in everybody's mouth in court circles
that Mme. Sanseverina was manifesting a great deal of friendly
interest in Count Baldi, that extremely handsome man and quondam
friend of the Marquise Raversi. The one thing certain was that he
and the Marquise had separated, and he was alleged to have behaved
most shamefully toward the lady who for six years had been to him a
mother and given him his standing in society.</p>
<p>The next morning, long before the sun was up, Grillo entered
Fabrice's cell, laid down what seemed to be a pretty heavy package,
and vanished without saying a word. The package contained a
good-sized loaf of bread, plentifully ornamented with, little
crosses made with a pen. Fabrice covered them with kisses. Why?
Because he was in love. Beside the loaf lay a rouleau incased in
many thicknesses of paper; it contained six thousand francs in
sequins. Finally, Fabrice discovered a handsome brand-new
prayer-book: these words, in a writing he was beginning to be
acquainted with, were written on the fly-leaf:--</p>
<p>"<i>Poison!</i> Beware the water, the wine, everything; confine
yourself to chocolate. Give the untasted dinner to the dog; it will
not do to show distrust; the enemy would have recourse to other
methods. For God's sake, be cautious! no rashness!"</p>
<p>Fabrice made haste to remove the telltale writing which might
have compromised Cl&eacute;lia, and to tear out a number of leaves
from the prayer-book, with which he made several alphabets; each
letter was neatly formed with powdered charcoal moistened with
wine. The alphabets were quite dry when at a quarter to twelve
Cl&eacute;lia appeared at the window of the aviary. "The main thing
now is to persuade her to use them," said Fabrice to himself. But
as it happened, fortunately, she had much to say to the young
prisoner in regard to the plan to poison him (a dog belonging to
one of the kitchen-maids had died after eating a dish cooked for
Fabrice), so that Cl&eacute;lia not only made no objection to the
use of the alphabets, but had herself prepared one in the highest
style of art with ink. Under this method, which did not work
altogether smoothly at the beginning, the conversation lasted an
hour and a half, which was as long as Cl&eacute;lia dared remain in
the aviary. Two or three times, when Fabrice trespassed on
forbidden ground and alluded to matters that were taboo, she made
no answer and walked away to feed her birds.</p>
<p>Fabrice requested that when she sent him his supply of water at
evening she would accompany it with one of her alphabets, which,
being traced in ink, were legible at a greater distance. He did not
fail to write her a good long letter, and was careful to put in it
no soft nonsense--at least, of a nature to offend.</p>
<p>The next day, in their alphabetical conversation, Cl&eacute;lia
had no reproach to make him. She informed him that there was less
to be apprehended from the poisoners. Barbone had been waylaid and
nearly murdered by the lovers of the Governor's scullery-maids; he
would scarcely venture to show his face in the kitchens again. She
owned up to stealing a counter-poison from her father; she sent it
to him with directions how to use it, but the main thing was to
reject at once all food that seemed to have an unnatural taste.</p>
<p>Cl&eacute;lia had subjected Don Cesare to a rigorous
examination, without succeeding in discovering whence came the six
thousand francs received by Fabrice. In any case, it was a good
sign: it showed that the severity of his confinement was
relaxing.</p>
<p>The poison episode had a very favorable effect on our hero's
amatory enterprise: still, he could never extort anything at all
resembling a confession of love; but he had the felicity of living
on terms of intimacy with Cl&eacute;lia. Every morning, and often
at evening also, there was a long conversation with the alphabets;
every evening at nine o'clock Cl&eacute;lia received a lengthy
letter, and sometimes accorded it a few brief words of answer; she
sent him the daily paper and an occasional new book; finally, the
rugged Grillo had been so far tamed as to keep Fabrice supplied
with bread and wine, which were handed him daily by Cl&eacute;lia's
maid. This led honest Grillo to conclude that the Governor was not
of the same mind as those who had engaged Barbone to poison the
young Monsignor; at which he rejoiced exceedingly, as did his
comrades, for there was a saying current in the prison--"You have
only to look Monsignor del Dongo in the face; he is certain to give
you money."</p>
<p>Fabrice was very pale; lack of exercise was injuring his health:
but for all that he had never been so happy. The tone of the
conversation between Cl&eacute;lia and him was familiar and often
gay. The only moments of the girl's life not beset with dark
forebodings and remorse were those spent in conversing with him.
She was so thoughtless as to remark one day:--</p>
<p>"I admire your delicacy: because I am the Governor's daughter
you have nothing to say to me of the pleasures of freedom!"</p>
<p>"That's because I am not so absurd as to have aspirations in
that direction," replied Fabrice. "How often could I hope to see
you if I were living in Parma, a free man again? And life would not
be worth living if I could not tell you all my thoughts--no, not
that exactly: you take precious good care I don't tell you
<i>all</i> my thoughts! But in spite of your cruel tyranny, to live
without seeing you daily would be a far worse punishment than
captivity; in all my life I was never so happy! Isn't it strange to
think happiness was awaiting me in a prison?"</p>
<p>"There is a good deal to be said on that point," rejoined
Cl&eacute;lia, with an air that all at once became very serious,
almost threatening.</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed Fabrice, in alarm, "am I in danger of losing
the small place I have won in your heart, my sole joy in this
world?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied. "Although your reputation in society is that
of a gentleman and gallant man, I have reason to believe you are
not acting ingenuously toward me. But I don't wish to discuss this
matter to-day."</p>
<p>This strange exordium cast an element of embarrassment into the
conversation, and tears were often in the eyes of both.</p>

<h2>WILLEM BILDERDIJK</h2>
<h3>(1756-1831)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-w.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>illem Bilderdijk's personality, even more than his genius,
exerted so powerful an influence over his time that it has been
said that to think of a Dutchman of the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth century was to think of Bilderdijk. He stands as the
representative of the great literary and intellectual awakening
which took place in Holland immediately after that country became
part of the French empire. The history of literature has many
examples of how, under political disturbances, the agitated mind
has sought refuge in literary and scientific pursuits, and it
seemed at that time as if Dutch literature was entering a new
Golden Age. The country had never known better poets; but it was
the poetry of the eighteenth century, to quote Ten Brink,
"ceremonious and stagy."</p>
<p>In 'Herinnering van mijne Kindheit' (Reminiscences of My
Childhood), a book which is not altogether to be relied upon,
Bilderdijk gives a charming picture of his father, a physician in
Amsterdam, but speaks of his mother in less flattering terms. He
was born in Amsterdam in 1756. At an early age he suffered an
injury to his foot, a peasant boy having carelessly stepped on it;
attempts were made to cure him by continued bleedings, and the
result was that he was confined to his bed for twelve years. These
years laid the foundation of a character lacking in power to love
and to call forth love, and developing into an almost fierce
hypochondria, full of complaints and fears of death. In these
years, however, he acquired the information and the wonderful power
of language which appear in his sinewy verse.</p>
<p>One of his poems, dated 1770, has been preserved, but is
principally interesting as a first attempt. Others, written in his
twentieth year, were prize poems, and are sufficiently
characterized by their titles:--'Kunst wordt door Arbeid verkregen'
(Art came through Toil), and 'Inloed der Dichthunst op het Staets
bestuur' (Influence of Poetry on Statesmanship). When he went to
Leyden in 1780 to study law, he was already famous. His
examinations passed, he settled at the Hague to practice, and in
1785 married Katharina Rebekka Woesthoven. The following year he
published his romance, 'Elius,' in seven songs. The romance
ultimately became his favorite form of verse; but this was not the
form now called romance. It was the rhymed narrative of the
eighteenth century, written with endless care and reflection, and
in his case with so superior a treatment of language that no Dutch
poet since Huygens had approached it.</p>
<p>The year 1795 was the turning-point in Bilderdijk's life. He had
been brought up in unswerving faith in the cause of the house of
Orange, was a fanatic monarchist and Calvinist,
"anti-revolutionary, anti-Barneveldtian, anti-Loevesteinisch,
anti-liberal" (thus Da Costa), a warm supporter of William the
Fifth, and at the entrance of the French in 1795 he refused to give
his oath of allegiance to the cause of the citizens and the
sovereignty of the people. He was exiled, left the Hague, and went
to London, and later to Brunswick. This was not altogether a
misfortune for him, nor an unrelieved sorrow. He had been more
successful as poet than as husband or financier, and by his
compulsory banishment escaped his financial difficulties and what
he considered the chains of his married life. In London Bilderdijk
met his countryman the painter Schweikhardt; and with this meeting
begins a period of his life over which his admirers would fain draw
a veil. With Schweikhardt were his two daughters, of whom the
younger, Katherina Wilhelmina, became Bilderdijk's first pupil,
and, excepting his "intellectual son," Isaak da Costa, probably his
only one. Besides her great poetic gifts she possessed beauty and
charm. She fell in love with her teacher and followed him to
Brunswick, where she lived in his house under the name of Frau van
Heusden. In spite of this arrangement, the poet seems to have
considered himself a most faithful husband; and he did his best to
persuade his wife to join him with their children, but naturally
without success. In 1802 the marriage was legally annulled, and
Frau van Heusden took his name. She did her best to atone for the
blot on her repute by a self-sacrificing lovableness, and was in
close sympathy with Bilderdijk on the intellectual side. Like him
she was familiar with all the resources of the art of poetry. Most
famous of her poems are the long one 'Rodrigo de Goth,' and her
touching, graceful 'Gedichten voor Kinderen' (Poems for Children).
Bilderdijk's verses show what she was to him:--</p>
<blockquote>In the shadow of my verdure, firmly on my trunk
depending,<br>
Grew the tender branch of cedar, never longing once to leave
me;<br>
Faithfully through rain and tempest, modest at my side it
rested,<br>
Bearing to my honor solely the first twig it might its own
call;<br>
Fair the wreath thy flowers made me for my knotted trunk fast
withering,<br>
And my soul with pride was swelling at the crown of thy young
blossoms;<br>
Straight and strong and firmly rooted, tall and green thy head
arises,<br>
Bright the glory of its freshness; never yet by aught bedimmed.<br>
Lo! my crown to thine now bending, only thine the radiant
freshness,<br>
And my soul finds rest and comfort in thy sheltering
foliage.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Meanwhile he was no better off materially. The Duke of
Brunswick, who had known him previously, received the famous Dutch
exile with open arms, and granted him a pension; but it never
sufficed. Many efforts were made to have his decree of exile
annulled; but they failed through his own peevish insolence and his
boundless ingratitude. King Louis (Bonaparte) of Holland extended
his protection to the dissatisfied old poet; and all these royal
gentlemen were most generous. When the house of Orange returned to
Holland, William I. continued the favor already shown him, obtained
a high pension for him, and when it proved insufficient,
supplemented it with gifts. In this way Bilderdijk's income in the
year 1816 amounted to twenty thousand gold pieces. That this should
be sufficient to keep the wolf from the door in a city like
Amsterdam, Bilderdijk thought too much to expect, and consequently
left in great indignation and went to Leyden in 1817.</p>
<p>But these personal troubles in no way interfered with his
talent. On the contrary, the history of literature has seldom known
so great an activity and productiveness; all in all, his works
amounted to almost a hundred volumes. What he accomplished during
his stay in Germany was almost incredible. He gave lessons to
exiled Dutch in a great variety of branches, he saw volume upon
volume through print; he wrote his famous 'Het Buitenleven'
(Country Life) after Delille, he translated Fingal after Ossian, he
wrote 'Vaderlandsche Orangezucht' (Patriotic Love for Orange).
After his return to Holland he wrote 'De Ziekte der Geleerden' (The
Disease of Genius: 1817), 'Leyden's Kamp' (Leyden's Battle: 1808),
and the first five songs of 'De Ondergang der eerste Wereld'
(Destruction of the First World: 1809), probably his masterpiece;
moreover, the dramas 'Floris V.,' 'Willem van Holland,' and
'Kounak.' The volumes published between 1815 and 1819 bore the
double signature Willem and Wilhelmina Katherina Bilderdijk.</p>
<p>But it was as though time had left him behind. The younger
Holland shook its head over the old gentleman of the past century,
with his antagonism for the poetry of the day and his rage against
Shakespeare and the latter's "puerile" 'King Lear.' For to
Bilderdijk even more than to Voltaire, Shakespeare was an
abomination. Then in 1830 he received the severest blow of his
life: Katherina Wilhelmina died. This happened in Haarlem, whither
he had gone in 1827. With this calamity his strength was broken and
his life at an end. He followed her in 1831.</p>
<p>He was in every way a son of the eighteenth century; he began as
a didactic and patriotic poet, and might at first be considered a
follower of Jakob Cats. He became principally a lyric poet, but his
lyric knew no deep sentiment, no suppressed feeling; its greatness
lay in its rhetorical power. His ode to Napoleon may therefore be
one of the best to characterize his genius. When he returned to his
native country after eleven years' exile, with heart and mind full
of Holland, it was old Holland he sought and did not find. He did
not understand young Holland. In spite of this, his fame and
powerful personality had an attraction for the young; but it was
the attraction of a past time, the fascination of the glorious
ruin. Young Holland wanted freedom, individual independence, and
this Bilderdijk considered a misfortune. "One should not let
children, women, and nations know that they possess other rights
than those naturally theirs. This matter must be a secret between
the prince and his heart and reason,--to the masses it ought always
to be kept as hidden as possible." The new age which had made its
entry with the cry of Liberty would not tolerate such sentiments,
and he stood alone, a powerful, demonic, but incomprehensible
spirit.</p>
<p>Aside from his fame as a poet, he deserves to be mentioned as
Jacob Grimm's correspondent, as philologist, philosopher, and
theologian.</p>

<br>
AN ORIENTAL ROMANCE<br>
<br>
Splendid rose the star of evening, and the gray dusk was
a-fading.<br>
O'er it with a hand of mildness, now the Night her veil was
drawing:<br>
Abensa&iuml;d, valiant soldier, from Medina's ancient gateway,<br>
To the meadows, rich with blossoms, walked in darkest mood of
musing--<br>
Where the Guadalete's wild waves foaming wander through the flat
lands,<br>
Where, within the harbor's safety, loves to wait the weary
seaman.<br>
Neither hero's mood nor birth-pride eased his spirit of its
suffering<br>
For his youth's betrothed, Zobe&iuml;de; she it was who caused him
anguish.<br>
Faithless had she him forsaken, she sometime his best-beloved,<br>
Left him, though already parted by strange fate, from realm and
heirship.<br>
Oh, that destiny he girds not--strength it gave him,
hero-courage,<br>
Added to his lofty spirit, touches of nobler feeling--<br>
'Tis that she, ill-starred one, leaves him! takes the hand so
wrinkled<br>
Of that old man, Seville's conqueror!<br>
Into the night, along the river, Abensa&iuml;d now forth
rushes:<br>
Loudly to the rocky limits, Echo bears his lamentations.<br>
"Faithless maid, more faithless art thou than the sullen water!<br>
Harder thou than even the hardened bosom of yon rigid rockwall!<br>
Ah, bethinkest thou, Zobe&iuml;de, still upon our solemn
love-oath?<br>
How thy heart, this hour so faithless, once belonged to me, me
only?<br>
Canst thou yield thy heart, thy beauty, to that old man, dead to
love-thoughts?<br>
Wilt thou try to love the tyrant lacking love despite his
treasure?<br>
Dost thou deem the sands of desert higher than are
virtue--honor?<br>
Allah grant, then, that he hate thee! That thou lovest yet
another!<br>
That thou soon thyself surrender to the scorned one's bitter
feeling.<br>
Rest may night itself deny thee, and may day to thee be terror!<br>
Be thy face before thy husband as a thing of nameless loathing!<br>
May his eye avoid thee ever, flee the splendor of thy beauty!<br>
May he ne'er, in gladsome gathering, stretch his hand to thee for
partner!<br>
Never gird himself with girdle which for him thy hand
embroidered!<br>
Let his heart, thy love forsaking, in another love be fettered;<br>
The love-tokens of another may his scutcheon flame in battle,<br>
While behind thy grated windows year by year, away thou
mournest!<br>
To thy rival may he offer prisoners that his hand has taken!<br>
May the trophies of his victory on his knees to <i>her</i> be
proffered!<br>
May he hate thee! and thy heart's faith to him be but thing
accursed!<br>
These things, aye and more still! be thy cure for all my sting and
sorrow!"<br>
Silent now goes Abensa&iuml;d, unto Xeres, in the midnight;<br>
Dazzling shone the palace, lighted, festal for the loathsome
marriage,<br>
Richly-robed Moors were standing 'neath the shimmer of the
tapers,<br>
On the jubilant procession of the marriage-part proceeded.<br>
In the path stands Abensa&iuml;d, frowning, as the bridegroom nears
him;<br>
Strikes the lance into his bosom, with the rage of sharpest
vengeance.<br>
'Gainst the heaven rings a loud cry, those at hand their swords are
baring--<br>
But he rushes through the weapons, and in safety gains his own
hearth.</blockquote>

<h2>BION</h2>
<h3>(275 B.C.)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-o.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>f Bion, the second of the Sicilian idyllists, of whom Theocritus
was the first and Moschus the third and last, but little knowledge
and few remains exist. He was born near Smyrna, says Suidas; and
from the elegy on his death, attributed to his pupil Moschus, we
infer that he lived in Sicily and died there of poison. "Say that
Bion the herdsman is dead," says the threnody, appealing to the
Sicilian muses, "and that song has died with Bion, and the Dorian
minstrelsy hath perished.... Poison came, Bion, to thy mouth. What
mortal so cruel as to mix poison for thee!" As Theocritus is also
mentioned in the idyl, Bion is supposed to have been his
contemporary, and to have flourished about 275 B. C.</p>
<p>Compared with Theocritus, his poetry is inferior in simplicity
and na&iuml;vet&eacute;, and declines from the type which
Theocritus had established for the out-door, open-field idyl. With
Bion, bucolics first took on the air of the study. Although at
first this art and affectation were rarely discernible, they
finally led to the mold of brass in which for centuries Italian and
English pastorals were cast, and later to the complete devitalizing
which marks English pastoral poetry in the eighteenth century, with
the one exception of Allan Ramsay's "Gentle Shepherd". Theocritus
had sung with genuine feeling of trees and wandering winds, of
flowers and the swift mountain stream. His poetry has atmosphere;
it is vital with sunlight, color, and the beauty which is cool and
calm and true. Although Bion's poems possess elegance and
sweetness, and abound in pleasing imagery, they lack the
naturalness of the idyls of Theocritus. Reflection has crept into
them; they are in fact love-songs, with here and there a tinge of
philosophy,</p>
<p>The most famous as well as the most powerful and original of
Bion's poems remaining to us is the threnody upon Adonis. It was
doubtless composed in honor of the rites with which Greek women
celebrated certain Eastern festivals; for the worship of Adonis
still lingered among them, mixed with certain Syrian customs.</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Thammuz came next behind,<br>
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured<br>
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br>
In amorous ditties all a summer's day,<br>
While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br>
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br>
Of Thammuz yearly wounded."</blockquote>
<p>Thammuz is identified with Adonis. "We came to a fair large
river," writes an old English traveler, "doubtless the ancient
river Adonis, which at certain seasons of the year, especially
about the feast of Adonis, is of a bloody color, which the heathens
looked upon as proceeding from a kind of sympathy in the river for
the death of Adonis, who was killed by a wild boar in the mountains
out of which the stream issues. Something like this we saw actually
come to pass; for the water was stained to a surprising redness,
and, as we observed in traveling, had discolored the sea a great
way into a reddish hue, occasioned doubtless by a sort of minium,
or red earth, washed into the river by the violence of the
rain."</p>
<p>The poem is colored by the Eastern nature of its subject, and
its rapidity, vehemence, warmth, and unrestraint are greater than
the strict canon of Greek art allows. It is noteworthy, aside from
its varied beauties, because of its fine abandonment to grief and
its appeal for recognition of the merits of the dead youth it
celebrates. Bion's threnody has undoubtedly become a criterion and
given the form to some of the more famous "songs of tears". The
laudatory clegy of Moschus for his master--we say of Moschus,
although Ahrens, in his recension, includes the lament under
'Incertorum Idyllia' at the end of 'Moschi Reliqui&aelig;'--follows
it faithfully. Milton in his great ode of 'Lycidas' does not depart
from the Greek lines; and Shelley, lamenting Keats in his
'Adona&iuml;s,' reverts still more closely to the first master,
adding perhaps an element of artificiality one does not find in
other threnodies. The broken and extended form of Tennyson's
celebration of Arthur Hallam takes it out of a comparison with the
Greek; but the monody of 'Thyrsis', Matthew Arnold's commemoration
of Clough, approaches nearer the Greek. Yet no other lament has the
energy and rapidity of Bion's; the refrain, the insistent
repetition of the words "I wail for Adonis",--"Alas for Cypris!"
full of pathos and unspoken irrepressible woe, is used only by his
pupil Moschus, though hinted at by Milton.</p>
<p>The peculiar rhythm, the passion and delicate finish of the
song, have attracted a number of translators, among whose versions
Mrs. Browning's 'The Lament for Adonis' is considered the best. The
subjoined version in the Spenserian stanza, by Anna C. Brackett,
follows its model closely in its directness and fervor of
expression, and has moreover in itself genuine poetic merit. The
translation of a fragment of 'Hesperos' is that of J.A. Symonds.
Bion's fluent and elegant versification invites study, and his few
idyls and fragments have at various times been turned into English
by Fawkes (to be found in Chalmers's 'Works of English Poets'),
Polwhele, Banks, Chapman, and others.</p>

<blockquote><b>THRENODY</b><br>
<br>
I weep for Adona&iuml;s--he is dead!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead Adona&iuml;s lies, and mourning all,<br>
The Loves wail round his fair, low-lying head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; O Cypris, sleep no more! Let from thee fall<br>
Thy purple vestments--hear'st thou not the call?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let fall thy purple vestments! Lay them by!<br>
Ah, smite thy bosom, and in sable pall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Send shivering through the air thy bitter cry<br>
For Adona&iuml;s dead, while all the Loves reply.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I weep for Adona&iuml;s--weep the Loves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low on the mountains beauteous
lies he there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And languid through his lips the faint breath
moves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And black the blood creeps o'er
his smooth thigh, where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boar's white tooth the
whiter flesh must tear.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glazed grow his eyes beneath the eyelids wide;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fades from his lips the rose,
and dies--Despair!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clinging kiss of Cypris at his side--<br>
Alas, he knew not that she kissed him as he died!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wail--responsive wail the Loves with me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, cruel, cruel is that wound
of thine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Cypris' heart-wound aches more bitterly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oreads weep; thy faithful
hounds low whine;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Cytherea's unbound tresses
fine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Float on the wind; where thorns her white feet
wound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the oaken glades drops
blood divine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; She calls her lover; he, all crimsoned round<br>
His fair white breast with blood, hears not the piteous sound.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! for Cytherea wail the Loves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beloved dies her
beauty too.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; O fair was she, the goddess borne of doves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Adona&iuml;s lived; but
now, so true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her love, no time her beauty
can renew.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep-voiced the mountains mourn; the oaks reply;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And springs and rivers murmur
sorrow through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The passes where she goes, the cities high;<br>
And blossoms flush with grief as she goes desolate by.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas for Cytherea! he hath died--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauteous Adona&iuml;s, he
is dead!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Echo sadly back "<i>is dead</i>" replied.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas for Cypris! Stooping low
her head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And opening wide her arms, she
piteous said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "O stay a little, Adona&iuml;s mine!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the kisses ours since we
were wed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But one last kiss, oh, give me now, and twine<br>
Thine arms close, till I drink the latest breath of thine!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "So will I keep the kiss thou givest me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en as it were thyself, thou
only best!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since thou, O Adona&iuml;s, far dost flee--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, stay a little--leave a
little rest!--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou wilt leave me, and
wilt be the guest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of proud Persephone, more
strong than I?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All beautiful obeys her dread
behest--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I a goddess am, and <i>cannot</i> die!<br>
O thrice-beloved, listen!--mak'st thou no reply?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then dies to idle air my longing wild,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dies a dream along the paths
of night;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Cytherea widowed is, exiled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From love itself; and now--an
idle sight--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Loves sit in my halls, and
all delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; My charm&egrave;d girdle moves, is all undone!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why wouldst thou, rash one,
seek the maddening fight?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, beauteous, wouldst thou not the combat
shun?"--<br>
Thus Cytherea--and the Loves weep, all as one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas for Cytherea!--he is dead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hopeless sorrow breaks in
tears, that rain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like summer showers, o'er
wind-down-beaten grain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They flow as fast as flows the
crimson stain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From out the wound, deep in the stiffening thigh;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! in roses red the blood
blooms fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where the tears divine have fallen close by,<br>
Spring up anemones, and stir all tremblingly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I weep for Adona&iuml;s--he is dead!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more, O Cypris, weep thy
wooer here!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold a bed of leaves! Lay down his head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he slept--as still, as
fair, as dear,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In softest garments let his
limbs appear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As when on golden couch his sweetest sleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slept the livelong night,
thy heart anear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, beautiful in death though sad he keep,<br>
No more to wake when Morning o'er the hills doth creep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And over him the freshest flowers fling--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! all flowers are withered
quite away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drop their petals wan! yet, perfumes bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sprinkle round, and
sweetest balsams lay;--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, perish perfumes since
thine shall not stay!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In purple mantle lies he, and around,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeping Loves his weapons
disarray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His sandals loose, with water bathe his wound,<br>
And fan him with soft wings that move without a sound.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Loves for Cytherea raise the wail.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hymen from quenched torch no
light can shake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His shredded wreath lies withered all and pale;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His joyous song, alas, harsh
discords break!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saddest wail of all, the
Graces wake;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "The beauteous Adona&iuml;s! He is dead!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sigh the Muses, "Stay but
for our sake!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet would he come, Persephone is dead;--<br>
Cease, Cypris! Sad the days repeat their faithful tread!<br>

<h2>AUGUSTINE BIRRELL</h2>
<h3>(1850-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>hose to whom the discovery of a relishing new literary flavor
means the permanent annexation of a new tract of enjoyment have not
forgotten what happened in 1885. A slender 16mo volume entitled
"Obiter Dicta", containing seven short literary and biographic
essays, came out in that year, anonymous and unheralded, to make
such way as it might among a book-whelmed generation. It had no
novelty of subject to help it to a hearing; the themes were largely
the most written-out, in all seeming, that could have been
selected,--a few great orthodox names on which opinion was closed
and analysis exhausted. Browning, Carlyle, Charles Lamb, and John
Henry Newman are indeed very beacons to warn off the sated bookman.
A paper on Benvenuto Cellini, one on Actors, and one on Falstaff
(by another hand) closed the list. Yet a few weeks made it the
literary event of the day. Among epicures of good reading the word
swiftly passed along that here was a new sensation of unusually
satisfying charm and freshness. It was a <i>tour de force</i> like
the "Innocents Abroad", a journey full of new sights over the most
staled and beaten of tracks. The triumph was all the author's
own.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-476.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Augustine Birrell.</b></p>
<p>Two years later came another volume as a "Second Series", of the
same general character but superior to the first. Among the
subjects of its eleven papers were Milton, Pope, Johnson, Burke,
Lamb again, and Emerson; with some general essays, including that
on "The Office of Literature", given below.</p>
<p>In 1892 appeared "Res Judicat&aelig;", really a third volume of
the same series, and perhaps even richer in matter and more acute
and original in thought. Its first two articles, prepared as
lectures on Samuel Richardson and Edward Gibbon, are indeed his
high-water, mark in both substance and style. Cowper, George
Borrow, Newman again, Lamb a third time (and fresh as ever),
Hazlitt, Matthew Arnold, and Sainte-Beuve are brought in, and some
excellent literary miscellanea.</p>
<p>A companion volume called 'Men, Women, and Books' is
disappointing because composed wholly of short newspaper articles:
Mr. Birrell's special quality needs space to make itself felt. He
needs a little time to get up steam, a little room to unpack his
wares; he is no pastel writer, who can say his say in a paragraph
and runs dry in two. Hence these snippy editorials do him no
justice: he is obliged to stop every time just as he is getting
ready to say something worth while. They are his, and therefore
readable and judicious; but they give no idea of his best
powers.</p>
<p>He has also written a life of Charlotte Bront&euml;. But he
holds his place in the front rank of recent essayists by the three
'Obiter Dicta' and 'Res Judicat&aelig;' volumes of manly, luminous,
penetrating essays, full of racy humor and sudden wit; of a
generous appreciativeness that seeks always for the vital principle
which gave the writer his hold on men; still more, of a warm
humanity and a sure instinct for all the higher and finer things of
the spirit which never fail to strike chords in the heart as well
as the brain. No writer's work leaves a better taste in the mouth;
he makes us think better of the world, of righteousness, of
ourselves. Yet no writer is less of a Puritan or a Philistine; none
writes with less of pragmatic purpose or a less obtrusive load of
positive fact. He scorns such overladen pedantry, and never loses a
chance to lash it. He tells us that he has "never been inside the
reading-room of the British Museum," and "expounds no theory save
the unworthy one that literature ought to please." He says the one
question about a book which is to be part of <i>literature</i> is,
"Does it read?" that "no one is under any obligation to read any
one else's book," and therefore it is a writer's business to make
himself welcome to readers; that he does not care whether an author
was happy or not, he wants the author to make him happy. He puts
his theory in practice: he makes himself welcome as a companion at
once stimulating and restful, of humane spirit and elevated ideals,
of digested knowledge and original thought, of an insight which is
rarely other than kindly and a deep humor which never lapses into
cynicism.</p>
<p>Mr. Birrell helps to justify Walter Bagehot's dictum that the
only man who can write books well is one who knows practical life
well; but still there are congruities in all things, and one feels
a certain shock of incongruity in finding that this man of books
and purveyor of light genial book-talk, who can hardly write a line
without giving it a quality of real literary savor, is a prominent
lawyer and member of Parliament, and has written a law book which
ranks among recognized legal authorities. This is a series of
lectures delivered in 1896, and collected into a volume on 'The
Duties and Liabilities of Trustees.' But some of the surprise
vanishes on reading the book: even as 'Alice in Wonderland' shows
on every page the work of a logician trained to use words precisely
and criticize their misuse, so in exactly the opposite way this
book is full of the shrewd judgment, the knowledge of life, and
even the delightful humor which form so much of Birrell's best
equipment for a man of letters.</p>
<p>Mr. Birrell's work is not merely good reading, but is a mental
clarifier and tonic. We are much better critics of other writers
through his criticisms on his selected subjects. After every
reading of 'Obiter Dicta' we feel ashamed of crass and petty
prejudice, in the face of his lessons in disregarding surface
mannerisms for the sake of vital qualities. Only in one case does
he lose his impartiality: he so objects to treating Emerson with
fairness that he even goes out of his way to berate his idol
Matthew Arnold for setting Emerson aloft. But what he says of
George Borrow is vastly more true of himself: he is one of the
writers we cannot afford to be angry with.</p>
<br>
<a name="BIRRELL_01"></a>
<center><b>DR. JOHNSON</b></center>
<br>
<p>"Criticism," writes Johnson in the 60th Idler, "is a study by
which men grow important and formidable at a very small expense.
The power of invention has been conferred by nature upon few, and
the labor of learning those sciences which may by mere labor be
obtained, is too great to be willingly endured: but every man can
exert such judgment as he has upon the works of others; and he whom
nature has made weak, and idleness keeps ignorant, may yet support
his vanity by the name of a critick."</p>
<p>To proceed with our task by the method of comparison is to
pursue a course open to grave objection; yet it is forced upon us
when we find, as we lately did, a writer in the Times newspaper, in
the course of a not very discriminating review of Mr. Froude's
recent volumes, casually remarking, as if it admitted of no more
doubt than the day's price of consols, that Carlyle was a greater
man than Johnson. It is a good thing to be positive. To be positive
in your opinions and selfish in your habits is the best recipe, if
not for happiness, at all events for that far more attainable
commodity, comfort, with which we are acquainted. "A noisy man,"
sang poor Cowper, who could not bear anything louder than the
hissing of a tea-urn, "a noisy man is always in the right," and a
positive man can seldom be proved wrong. Still, in literature it is
very desirable to preserve a moderate measure of independence, and
we therefore make bold to ask whether it is as plain as the "old
hill of Howth" that Carlyle was a greater man than Johnson? Is not
the precise contrary the truth? No abuse of Carlyle need be looked
for, here or from me. When a man of genius and of letters happens
to have any striking virtues, such as purity, temperance, honesty,
the novel task of dwelling on them has such attraction for us that
we are content to leave the elucidation of his faults to his
personal friends, and to stern, unbending moralists like Mr. Edmund
Yates and the World newspaper. To love Carlyle is, thanks to Mr.
Froude's superhuman ideal of friendship, a task of much heroism,
almost meriting a pension; still it is quite possible for the
candid and truth-loving soul. But a greater than Johnson he most
certainly was not.</p>
<p>There is a story in Boswell of an ancient beggar-woman who,
whilst asking an alms of the Doctor, described herself to him, in a
lucky moment for her pocket, as "an old struggler." Johnson, his
biographer tells us, was visibly affected. The phrase stuck to his
memory, and was frequently applied to himself. "I too," so he would
say, "am an old struggler." So too, in all conscience, was Carlyle.
The struggles of Johnson have long been historical; those of
Carlyle have just become so. We are interested in both. To be
indifferent would be inhuman. Both men had great endowments,
tempestuous natures, hard lots. They were not amongst Dame
Fortune's favorites. They had to fight their way. What they took
they took by storm. But--and here is a difference indeed--Johnson
came off victorious, Carlyle did not.</p>
<p>Boswell's book is an arch of triumph, through which, as we read,
we see his hero passing into eternal fame, to take up his place
with those--</p>
<blockquote>"Dead but sceptred sovereigns who still rule<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our spirits from their urns."</blockquote>
<p>Froude's book is a tomb over which the lovers of Carlyle's
genius will never cease to shed tender but regretful tears.</p>
<p>We doubt whether there is in English literature a more
triumphant book than Boswell's. What materials for tragedy are
wanting? Johnson was a man of strong passions, unbending spirit,
violent temper, as poor as a church-mouse, and as proud as the
proudest of Church dignitaries; endowed with the strength of a
coal-heaver, the courage of a lion, and the tongue of Dean Swift,
he could knock down booksellers and silence bargees; he was
melancholy almost to madness, "radically wretched," indolent,
blinded, diseased. Poverty was long his portion; not that genteel
poverty that is sometimes behindhand with its rent, but that hungry
poverty that does not know where to look for its dinner. Against
all these things had this "old struggler" to contend; over all
these things did this "old struggler" prevail. Over even the fear
of death, the giving up of "this intellectual being," which had
haunted his gloomy fancy for a lifetime, he seems finally to have
prevailed, and to have met his end as a brave man should.</p>
<p>Carlyle, writing to his wife, says, and truthfully enough, "The
more the devil worries me the more I wring him by the nose;" but
then if the devil's was the only nose that was wrung in the
transaction, why need Carlyle cry out so loud? After buffeting
one's way through the storm-tossed pages of Froude's (Carlyle,)--in
which the universe is stretched upon the rack because food
disagrees with man and cocks crow,--with what thankfulness and
reverence do we read once again the letter in which Johnson tells
Mrs. Thrale how he has been called to endure, not dyspepsia or
sleeplessness, but paralysis itself:--</p>
<p>"On Monday I sat for my picture, and walked a considerable way
with little inconvenience. In the afternoon and evening I felt
myself light and easy, and began to plan schemes of life. Thus I
went to bed, and in a short time waked and sat up, as has long been
my custom; when I felt a confusion in my head which lasted, I
suppose, about half a minute; I was alarmed, and prayed God that
however much He might afflict my body He would spate my
understanding.... Soon after I perceived that I had suffered a
paralytic stroke, and that my speech was taken from me. I had no
pain, and so little dejection in this dreadful state that I
wondered at my own apathy, and considered that perhaps death
itself, when it should come, would excite less horror than seems
now to attend it. In order to rouse the vocal organs I took two
drams.... I then went to bed, and strange as it may seem I think
slept. When I saw light it was time I should contrive what I should
do. Though God stopped my speech, He left me my hand. I enjoyed a
mercy which was not granted to my dear friend Lawrence, who now
perhaps overlooks me as I am writing, and rejoices that I have what
he wanted. My first note was necessarily to my servant, who came in
talking, and could not immediately comprehend why he should read
what I put into his hands.... How this will be received by you I
know not. I hope you will sympathize with me; but perhaps</p>
<blockquote>"'My mistress, gracious, mild, and good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cries--Is he dumb? 'Tis time he should.'</blockquote>
<p>"I suppose you may wish to know how my disease is treated by the
physicians. They put a blister upon my back, and two from my ear to
my throat, one on a side. The blister on the back has done little,
and those on the throat have not risen. I bullied and bounced (it
sticks to our last sand), and compelled the apothecary to make his
salve according to the Edinburgh dispensatory, that it might adhere
better. I have now two on my own prescription. They likewise give
me salt of hartshorn, which I take with no great confidence; but I
am satisfied that what can be done is done for me. I am almost
ashamed of this querulous letter, but now it is written let it
go."</p>
<p>This is indeed tonic and bark for the mind.</p>
<p>If, irritated by a comparison that ought never to have been
thrust upon us, we ask why it is that the reader of Boswell finds
it as hard to help loving Johnson as the reader of Froude finds it
hard to avoid disliking Carlyle, the answer must be that whilst the
elder man of letters was full to overflowing with the milk of human
kindness, the younger one was full to overflowing with something
not nearly so nice; and that whilst Johnson was pre-eminently a
reasonable man, reasonable in all his demands and expectations,
Carlyle was the most unreasonable mortal that ever exhausted the
patience of nurse, mother, or wife.</p>
<p>Of Dr. Johnson's affectionate nature nobody has written with
nobler appreciation than Carlyle himself. "Perhaps it is this
Divine feeling of affection, throughout manifested, that
principally attracts us to Johnson. A true brother of men is he,
and filial lover of the earth."</p>
<p>The day will come when it will be recognized that Carlyle, as a
critic, is to be judged by what he himself corrected for the press,
and not by splenetic entries in diaries, or whimsical extravagances
in private conversation.</p>
<p>Of Johnson's reasonableness nothing need be said, except that it
is patent everywhere. His wife's judgment was a sound one--"He is
the most sensible man I ever met."</p>
<p>As for his brutality, of which at one time we used to hear a
great deal, we cannot say of it what Hookham Frere said of Lander's
immorality, that it was--</p>
<blockquote>"Mere imaginary classicality<br>
Wholly devoid of criminal reality."</blockquote>
<p>It was nothing of the sort. Dialectically the great Doctor was a
great brute. The fact is, he had so accustomed himself to wordy
warfare that he lost all sense of moral responsibility, and cared
as little for men's feelings as a Napoleon did for their lives.
When the battle was over, the Doctor frequently did what no soldier
ever did that I have heard tell of,--apologized to his victims and
drank wine or lemonade with them. It must also be remembered that
for the most part his victims sought him out. They came to be
tossed and gored. And after all, are they so much to be pitied?
They have our sympathy, and the Doctor has our applause. I am not
prepared to say, with the simpering fellow with weak legs whom
David Copperfield met at Mr. Waterbrook's dinner-table, that I
would sooner be knocked down by a man with blood than picked up by
a man without any; but, argumentatively speaking, I think it would
be better for a man's reputation to be knocked down by Dr. Johnson
than picked up by Mr. Froude.</p>
<p>Johnson's claim to be the best of our talkers cannot, on our
present materials, be contested. For the most part we have only
talk about other talkers. Johnson's is matter of record. Carlyle no
doubt was a great talker--no man talked against talk or broke
silence to praise it more eloquently than he, but unfortunately
none of it is in evidence. All that is given us is a sort of
Commination Service writ large. We soon weary of it. Man does not
live by curses alone.</p>
<p>An unhappier prediction of a boy's future was surely never made
than that of Johnson's by his cousin, Mr. Cornelius Ford, who said
to the infant Samuel, "You will make your way the more easily in
the world as you are content to dispute no man's claim to
conversation excellence, and they will, therefore, more willingly
allow your pretensions as a writer." Unfortunate Mr. Ford! The man
never breathed whose claim to conversation excellence Dr. Johnson
did not dispute on every possible occasion; whilst, just because he
was admittedly so good a talker, his pretensions as a writer have
been occasionally slighted.</p>
<p>Johnson's personal character has generally been allowed to stand
high. It, however, has not been submitted to recent tests. To be
the first to "smell a fault" is the pride of the modern biographer.
Boswell's artless pages afford useful hints not lightly to be
disregarded. During some portion of Johnson's married life he had
lodgings, first at Greenwich, afterwards at Hampstead. But he did
not always go home o' nights; sometimes preferring to roam the
streets with that vulgar ruffian Savage, who was certainly no fit
company for him. He once actually quarreled with Tetty, who,
despite her ridiculous name, was a very sensible woman with a very
sharp tongue, and for a season, like stars, they dwelt apart. Of
the real merits of this dispute we must resign ourselves to
ignorance. The materials for its discussion do not exist; even
Croker could not find them. Neither was our great moralist as sound
as one would have liked to see him in the matter of the payment of
small debts. When he came to die, he remembered several of these
outstanding accounts; but what assurance have we that he remembered
them all? One sum of &pound;10 he sent across to the honest fellow
from whom he had borrowed it, with an apology for his delay; which,
since it had extended over a period of twenty years, was not
superfluous. I wonder whether he ever repaid Mr. Dilly the guinea
he once borrowed of him to give to a very small boy who had just
been apprenticed to a printer. If he did not, it was a great shame.
That he was indebted to Sir Joshua in a small loan is apparent from
the fact that it was one of his three dying requests to that great
man that he should release him from it, as, of course, the most
amiable of painters did. The other two requests, it will be
remembered, were to read his Bible, and not to use his brush on
Sundays. The good Sir Joshua gave the desired promises with a full
heart, for these two great men loved one another; but subsequently
discovered the Sabbatical restriction not a little irksome, and
after a while resumed his former practice, arguing with himself
that the Doctor really had no business to extract any such promise.
The point is a nice one, and perhaps ere this the two friends have
met and discussed it in the Elysian fields. If so, I hope the
Doctor, grown "angelical," kept his temper with the mild shade of
Reynolds better than on the historical occasion when he discussed
with him the question of "strong drinks."</p>
<p>Against Garrick, Johnson undoubtedly cherished a smoldering
grudge, which, however, he never allowed any one but himself to fan
into flame. His pique was natural. Garrick had been his pupil at
Edial, near Lichfield; they had come up to town together with an
easy united fortune of fourpence--"current coin o' the realm."
Garrick soon had the world at his feet and garnered golden grain.
Johnson became famous too, but remained poor and dingy. Garrick
surrounded himself with what only money can buy, good pictures and
rare books. Johnson cared nothing for pictures--how should he? he
could not see them; but he did care a great deal about books, and
the pernickety little player was chary about lending his splendidly
bound rarities to his quondam preceptor. Our sympathies in this
matter are entirely with Garrick; Johnson was one of the best men
that ever lived, but not to lend books to. Like Lady Slattern, he
had a "most observant thumb." But Garrick had no real cause for
complaint. Johnson may have soiled his folios and sneered at his
trade, but in life Johnson loved Garrick, and in death embalmed his
memory in a sentence which can only die with the English
language:--"I am disappointed by that stroke of death which has
eclipsed the gayety of nations, and impoverished the public stock
of harmless pleasure."</p>
<p>Will it be believed that puny critics have been found to quarrel
with this colossal compliment on the poor pretext of its falsehood?
Garrick's death, urge these dullards, could not possibly have
eclipsed the gayety of nations, since he had retired from the stage
months previous to his demise. When will mankind learn that
literature is one thing, and sworn testimony another? ...</p>
<p>Johnson the author is not always fairly treated. Phrases are
convenient things to hand about, and it is as little the custom to
inquire into their truth as it is to read the letterpress on
bank-notes. We are content to count bank-notes and to repeat
phrases. One of these phrases is, that whilst everybody reads
Boswell, nobody reads Johnson. The facts are otherwise. Everybody
does not read Boswell, and a great many people do read Johnson. If
it be asked, What do the general public know of Johnson's nine
volumes octavo? I reply, Beshrew the general public! What in the
name of the Bodleian has the general public got to do with
literature? The general public subscribes to Mudie, and has its
intellectual, like its lacteal sustenance, sent round to it in
carts. On Saturdays these carts, laden with "recent works in
circulation," traverse the Uxbridge Road; on Wednesdays they toil
up Highgate Hill, and if we may believe the reports of travelers,
are occasionally seen rushing through the wilds of Camberwell and
bumping over Blackheath. It is not a question of the general
public, but of the lover of letters. Do Mr. Browning, Mr. Arnold,
Mr. Lowell, Mr. Trevelyan, Mr. Stephen, Mr. Morley, know their
Johnson? "To doubt would be disloyalty." And what these big men
know in their big way, hundreds of little men know in their little
way. We have no writer with a more genuine literary flavor about
him than the great Cham of literature. No man of letters loved
letters better than he. He knew literature in all its branches--he
had read books, he had written books, he had sold books, he had
bought books, and he had borrowed them. Sluggish and inert in all
other directions, he pranced through libraries. He loved a
catalogue; he delighted in an index. He was, to employ a happy
phrase of Dr. Holmes, at home amongst books as a stable-boy is
amongst horses. He cared intensely about the future of literature
and the fate of literary men. "I respect Millar," he once
exclaimed; "he has raised the price of literature." Now Millar was
a Scotchman. Even Horne Tooke was not to stand in the pillory: "No,
no, the dog has too much literature for that." The only time the
author of 'Rasselas' met the author of the 'Wealth of Nations'
witnessed a painful scene. The English moralist gave the Scotch one
the lie direct, and the Scotch moralist applied to the English one
a phrase which would have done discredit to the lips of a
costermonger; but this notwithstanding, when Boswell reported that
Adam Smith preferred rhyme to blank verse, Johnson hailed the news
as enthusiastically as did Cedric the Saxon the English origin of
the bravest knights in the retinue of the Norman king. "Did Adam
say that?" he shouted: "I love him for it. I could hug him!"
Johnson no doubt honestly believed he held George III. in
reverence, but really he did not care a pin's fee for all the
crowned heads of Europe. All his reverence was reserved for "poor
scholars." When a small boy in a wherry, on whom had devolved the
arduous task of rowing Johnson and his biographer across the
Thames, said he would give all he had to know about the Argonauts,
the Doctor was much pleased, and gave him, or got Boswell to give
him, a double fare. He was ever an advocate of the spread of
knowledge amongst all classes and both sexes. His devotion to
letters has received its fitting reward, the love and respect of
all "lettered hearts."</p>

<br>
<p>Dr. John Brown's pleasant story has become well known, of the
countryman who, being asked to account for the gravity of his dog,
replied, "Oh, sir! life is full of sairiousness to him--he can just
never get eneugh o' fechtin'." Something of the spirit of this
saddened dog seems lately to have entered into the very people who
ought to be freest from it,--our men of letters. They are all very
serious and very quarrelsome. To some of them it is dangerous even
to allude. Many are wedded to a theory or period, and are the most
uxorious of husbands--ever ready to resent an affront to their
lady. This devotion makes them very grave, and possibly very happy
after a pedantic fashion. One remembers what Hazlitt, who was
neither happy nor pedantic, has said about pedantry:--</p>
<p>"The power of attaching an interest to the most trifling or
painful pursuits is one of the greatest happinesses of our nature.
The common soldier mounts the breach with joy, the miser
deliberately starves himself to death, the mathematician sets about
extracting the cube-root with a feeling of enthusiasm, and the
lawyer sheds tears of delight over 'Coke upon Lyttleton.' He who is
not in some measure a pedant, though he may be a wise, cannot be a
very happy man."</p>
<p>Possibly not; but then we are surely not content that our
authors should be pedants in order that they may be happy and
devoted. As one of the great class for whose sole use and behalf
literature exists,--the class of readers,--I protest that it is to
me a matter of indifference whether an author is happy or not. I
want him to make me happy. That is his office. Let him discharge
it.</p>
<p>I recognize in this connection the corresponding truth of what
Sydney Smith makes his Peter Plymley say about the private virtues
of Mr. Perceval, the Prime Minister:--</p>
<p>"You spend a great deal of ink about the character of the
present Prime Minister. Grant all that you write--I say, I fear
that he will ruin Ireland, and pursue a line of policy destructive
to the true interests of his country; and then you tell me that he
is faithful to Mrs. Perceval and kind to the Master Percevals. I
should prefer that he whipped his boys and saved his country."</p>
<p>We should never confuse functions or apply wrong tests. What can
books do for us? Dr. Johnson, the least pedantic of men, put the
whole matter into a nut-shell (a cocoa-nut shell, if you
will--Heaven forbid that I should seek to compress the great Doctor
within any narrower limits than my metaphor requires) when he wrote
that a book should teach us either to enjoy life or endure it.
"Give us enjoyment!" "Teach us endurance!" Hearken to the ceaseless
demand and the perpetual prayer of an ever unsatisfied and always
suffering humanity!</p>
<p>How is a book to answer the ceaseless demand?</p>
<p>Self-forgetfulness is the essence of enjoyment, and the author
who would confer pleasure must possess the art, or know the trick,
of destroying for the time the reader's own personality.
Undoubtedly the easiest way of doing this is by the creation of a
host of rival personalities--hence the number and the popularity of
novels. Whenever a novelist fails, his book is said to flag; that
is, the reader suddenly (as in skating) comes bump down upon his
own personality, and curses the unskillful author. No lack of
characters, and continual motion, is the easiest recipe for a
novel, which like a beggar should always be kept "moving on."
Nobody knew this better than Fielding, whose novels, like most good
ones, are full of inns.</p>
<p>When those who are addicted to what is called "improving
reading" inquire of you petulantly why you cannot find change of
company and scene in books of travel, you should answer cautiously
that when books of travel are full of inns, atmosphere, and motion,
they are as good as any novel; nor is there any reason in the
nature of things why they should not always be so, though
experience proves the contrary.</p>
<p>The truth or falsehood of a book is immaterial. George Borrow's
'Bible in Spain' is, I suppose, true; though now that I come to
think of it in what is to me a new light, one remembers that it
contains some odd things. But was not Borrow the accredited agent
of the British and Foreign Bible Society? Did he not travel (and he
had a free hand) at their charges? Was he not befriended by our
minister at Madrid, Mr. Villiers, subsequently Earl of Clarendon in
the peerage of England? It must be true: and yet at this moment I
would as lief read a chapter of the 'Bible in Spain' as I would
'Gil Bias'; nay, I positively would give the preference to
Se&ntilde;or Giorgio. Nobody can sit down to read Borrow's books
without as completely forgetting himself as if he were a boy in the
forest with Gurth and Wamba.</p>
<p>Borrow is provoking and has his full share of faults, and though
the owner of a style, is capable of excruciating offences. His
habitual use of the odious word "individual" as a noun-substantive
(seven times in three pages of 'The Romany Rye') elicits the
frequent groan, and he is certainly once guilty of calling fish the
"finny tribe." He believed himself to be animated by an intense
hatred of the Church of Rome, and disfigures many of his pages by
Lawrence-Boythorn-like tirades against that institution; but no
Catholic of sense need on this account deny himself the pleasure of
reading Borrow, whose one dominating passion was
<i>camaraderie</i>, and who hob-a-nobbed in the friendliest spirit
with priest and gipsy in a fashion as far beyond praise as it is
beyond description by any pen other than his own. Hail to thee,
George Borrow! Cervantes himself, 'Gil Bias,' do not more
effectually carry their readers into the land of the Cid than does
this miraculous agent of the Bible Society, by favor of whose
pleasantness we can, any hour of the week, enter Villafranca by
night, or ride into Galicia on an Andalusian stallion (which proved
to be a foolish thing to do), without costing anybody a
<i>peseta</i>, and at no risk whatever to our necks--be they long
or short.</p>
<p>Cooks, warriors, and authors must be judged by the effects they
produce: toothsome dishes, glorious victories, pleasant
books--these are our demands. We have nothing to do with
ingredients, tactics, or methods. We have no desire to be admitted
into the kitchen, the council, or the study. The cook may clean her
saucepans how she pleases--the warrior place his men as he
likes--the author handle his material or weave his plot as best he
can--when the dish is served we only ask, Is it good? when the
battle has been fought, Who won? when the book comes out, Does it
read?</p>
<p>Authors ought not to be above being reminded that it is their
first duty to write agreeably; some very disagreeable ones have
succeeded in doing so, and there is therefore no need for any one
to despair. Every author, be he grave or gay, should try to make
his book as ingratiating as possible. Reading is not a duty, and
has consequently no business to be made disagreeable. Nobody is
under any obligation to read any other man's book.</p>
<p>Literature exists to please,--to lighten the burden of men's
lives; to make them for a short while forget their sorrows and
their sins, their silenced hearths, their disappointed hopes, their
grim futures--and those men of letters are the best loved who have
best performed literature's truest office. Their name is happily
legion, and I will conclude these disjointed remarks by quoting
from one of them, as honest a parson as ever took tithe or voted
for the Tory candidate, the Rev. George Crabbe. Hear him in 'The
Frank Courtship':--</p>
<blockquote>"I must be loved," said Sybil; "I must see<br>
The man in terrors, who aspires to me:<br>
At my forbidding frown his heart must ache,<br>
His tongue must falter, and his frame must shake;<br>
And if I grant him at my feet to kneel,<br>
What trembling fearful pleasure must he feel!<br>
Nay, such the rapture that my smiles inspire<br>
That reason's self must for a time retire."<br>
"Alas! for good Josiah," said the dame,<br>
"These wicked thoughts would fill his soul with shame;<br>
He kneel and tremble at a thing of dust!<br>
He cannot, child:"--the child replied, "He must."</blockquote>
<p>Were an office to be opened for the insurance of literary
reputations, no critic at all likely to be in the society's service
would refuse the life of a poet who could write like Crabbe.
Cardinal Newman, Mr. Leslie Stephen, Mr. Swinburne, are not always
of the same way of thinking, but all three hold the one true faith
about Crabbe.</p>
<p>But even were Crabbe now left unread, which is very far from
being the case, his would be an enviable fame--for was he not one
of the favored poets of Walter Scott, and whenever the closing
scene of the great magician's life is read in the pages of
Lockhart, must not Crabbe's name be brought upon the reader's
quivering lip?</p>
<p>To soothe the sorrow of the soothers of sorrow, to bring tears
to the eyes and smiles to the cheeks of the lords of human smiles
and tears, is no mean ministry, and it is Crabbe's.</p>

<center><b>TRUTH-HUNTING</b></center>
<br>
<p>Is truth-hunting one of those active mental habits which, as
Bishop Butler tells us, intensify their effects by constant use;
and are weak convictions, paralyzed intellects, and laxity of
opinions amongst the effects of Truth-hunting on the majority of
minds? These are not unimportant questions.</p>
<p>Let us consider briefly the probable effects of speculative
habits on conduct.</p>
<p>The discussion of a question of conduct has the great charm of
justifying, if indeed not requiring, personal illustration; and
this particular question is well illustrated by instituting a
comparison between the life and character of Charles Lamb and those
of some of his distinguished friends.</p>
<p>Personal illustration, especially when it proceeds by way of
comparison, is always dangerous, and the dangers are doubled when
the subjects illustrated and compared are favorite authors. It
behoves us to proceed warily in this matter. A dispute as to the
respective merits of Gray and Collins has been known to result in a
visit to an attorney and the revocation of a will. An avowed
inability to see anything in Miss Austen's novels is reported to
have proved destructive of an otherwise good chance of an Indian
judgeship. I believe, however, I run no great risk in asserting
that, of all English authors, Charles Lamb is the one loved most
warmly and emotionally by his admirers, amongst whom I reckon only
those who are as familiar with the four volumes of his 'Life and
Letters' as with 'Elia.'</p>
<p>But how does he illustrate the particular question now engaging
our attention?</p>
<p>Speaking of his sister Mary, who, as every one knows, throughout
'Elia' is called his cousin Bridget, he says:--</p>
<p>"It has been the lot of my cousin, oftener perhaps than I could
have wished, to have had for her associates and mine free-thinkers,
leaders and disciples of novel philosophies and systems; but she
neither wrangles with nor accepts their opinions."</p>
<p>Nor did her brother. He lived his life cracking his little jokes
and reading his great folios, neither wrangling with nor accepting
the opinions of the friends he loved to see around him. To a
contemporary stranger it might well have appeared as if his life
were a frivolous and useless one as compared with those of these
philosophers and thinkers. <i>They</i> discussed their great
schemes and affected to prove deep mysteries, and were constantly
asking, "What is truth?" <i>He</i> sipped his glass, shuffled his
cards, and was content with the humbler inquiry, "What are trumps?"
But to us, looking back upon that little group, and knowing what we
now do about each member of it, no such mistake is possible. To us
it is plain beyond all question that, judged by whatever standard
of excellence it is possible for any reasonable human being to
take, Lamb stands head and shoulders a better man than any of them.
No need to stop to compare him with Godwin, or Hazlitt, or Lloyd;
let us boldly put him in the scales with one whose fame is in all
the churches--with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, "logician,
metaphysician, bard."</p>
<p>There are some men whom to abuse is pleasant. Coleridge is not
one of them. How gladly we would love the author of 'Christabel' if
we could! But the thing is flatly impossible. His was an unlovely
character. The sentence passed upon him by Mr. Matthew Arnold
(parenthetically, in one of the 'Essays in Criticism')--"Coleridge
had no morals"--is no less just than pitiless. As we gather
information about him from numerous quarters, we find it impossible
to resist the conclusion that he was a man neglectful of restraint,
irresponsive to the claims of those who had every claim upon him,
willing to receive, slow to give.</p>
<p>In early manhood Coleridge planned a Pantisocracy where all the
virtues were to thrive. Lamb did something far more difficult: he
played cribbage every night with his imbecile father, whose
constant stream of querulous talk and fault-finding might well have
goaded a far stronger man into practicing and justifying
neglect.</p>
<p>That Lamb, with all his admiration for Coleridge, was well aware
of dangerous tendencies in his character, is made apparent by many
letters, notably by one written in 1796, in which he says:--</p>
<p>"O my friend, cultivate the filial feelings! and let no man
think himself released from the kind charities of relationship:
these shall give him peace at the last; these are the best
foundation for every species of benevolence. I rejoice to hear that
you are reconciled with all your relations."</p>
<p>This surely is as valuable an "aid to reflection" as any
supplied by the Highgate seer.</p>
<p>Lamb gave but little thought to the wonderful difference between
the "reason" and the "understanding." He preferred old plays--an
odd diet, some may think, on which to feed the virtues; but however
that may be, the noble fact remains, that he, poor, frail boy! (for
he was no more, when trouble first assailed him) stooped down, and
without sigh or sign took upon his own shoulders the whole burden
of a lifelong sorrow.</p>
<p>Coleridge married. Lamb, at the bidding of duty, remained
single, wedding himself to the sad fortunes of his father and
sister. Shall we pity him? No; he had his reward--the surpassing
reward that is only within the power of literature to bestow. It
was Lamb, and not Coleridge, who wrote 'Dream-Children: a
Reverie':--</p>
<p>"Then I told how for seven long years, in hope sometimes,
sometimes in despair, yet persisting ever, I courted the fair Alice
W---- n; and as much as children could understand, I explained to
them what coyness and difficulty and denial meant in maidens--when,
suddenly turning to Alice, the soul of the first Alice looked out
at her eyes with such a reality of representment that I became in
doubt which of them stood before me, or whose that bright hair was;
and while I stood gazing, both the children gradually grew fainter
to my view, receding and still receding, till nothing at last but
two mournful features were seen in the uttermost distance, which,
without speech, strangely impressed upon me the effects of speech.
'We are not of Alice nor of thee, nor are we children at all. The
children of Alice call Bartrum father. We are nothing, less than
nothing, and dreams. We are only <i>what might have been</i>.'"</p>
<p>Godwin! Hazlitt! Coleridge! Where now are their "novel
philosophies and systems"? Bottled moonshine, which does <i>not</i>
improve by keeping.</p>
<blockquote>"Only the actions of the just<br>
Smell sweet and blossom in the dust."</blockquote>
<p>Were we disposed to admit that Lamb would in all probability
have been as good a man as every one agrees he was--as kind to his
father, as full of self-sacrifice for the sake of his sister, as
loving and ready a friend--even though he had paid more heed to
current speculations, it is yet not without use in a time like
this, when so much stress is laid upon anxious inquiry into the
mysteries of soul and body, to point out how this man attained to a
moral excellence denied to his speculative contemporaries;
performed duties from which they, good men as they were, would one
and all have shrunk: how, in short, he contrived to achieve what no
one of his friends, not even the immaculate Wordsworth or the
precise Southey, achieved--the living of a life the records of
which are inspiriting to read, and are indeed "the presence of a
good diffused"; and managed to do it all without either "wrangling
with or accepting" the opinions that "hurtled in the air" about
him.</p>

<center><b>BENVENUTO CELLINI</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Obiter Dicta'</center>
<br>
<p>What a liar was Benvenuto Cellini!--who can believe a word he
says? To hang a dog on his oath would be a judicial murder. Yet
when we lay down his Memoirs and let our thoughts travel back to
those far-off days he tells us of, there we see him standing, in
bold relief, against the black sky of the past, the very man he
was. Not more surely did he, with that rare skill of his, stamp the
image of Clement VII. on the papal currency, than he did the
impress of his own singular personality upon every word he spoke
and every sentence he wrote.</p>
<p>We ought, of course, to hate him, but do we? A murderer he has
written himself down. A liar he stands self-convicted of being.
Were any one in the nether world bold enough to call him thief, it
may be doubted whether Rhadamanthus would award him the damages for
which we may be certain he would loudly clamor. Why do we not hate
him? Listen to him:--</p>
<p>"Upon my uttering these words, there was a general outcry, the
noblemen affirming that I promised too much. But one of them, who
was a great philosopher, said in my favor, 'From the admirable
symmetry of shape and happy physiognomy of this young man, I
venture to engage that he will perform all he promises, and more.'
The Pope replied, 'I am of the same opinion;' then calling Trajano,
his gentleman of the bedchamber, he ordered him to fetch me five
hundred ducats."</p>
<p>And so it always ended: suspicions, aroused most reasonably,
allayed most unreasonably, and then--ducats. He deserved hanging,
but he died in his bed. He wrote his own memoirs after a fashion
that ought to have brought posthumous justice upon him, and made
them a literary gibbet, on which he should swing, a creaking
horror, for all time; but nothing of the sort has happened. The
rascal is so symmetrical, and his physiognomy, as it gleams upon us
through the centuries, so happy, that we cannot withhold our
ducats, though we may accompany the gift with a shower of
abuse.</p>
<p>This only proves the profundity of an observation made by Mr.
Bagehot--a man who carried away into the next world more
originality of thought than is now to be found in the Three Estates
of the Realm. Whilst remarking upon the extraordinary reputation of
the late Francis Horner and the trifling cost he was put to in
supporting it, Mr. Bagehot said that it proved the advantage of
"keeping an atmosphere."</p>
<p>The common air of heaven sharpens men's judgments. Poor Horner,
but for that kept atmosphere of his always surrounding him, would
have been bluntly asked "what he had done since he was breeched,"
and in reply he could only have muttered something about the
currency. As for our special rogue Cellini, the question would
probably have assumed this shape: "Rascal, name the crime you have
not committed, and account for the omission."</p>
<p>But these awkward questions are not put to the lucky people who
keep their own atmospheres. The critics, before they can get at
them, have to step out of the every-day air, where only
achievements count and the Decalogue still goes for something, into
the kept atmosphere, which they have no sooner breathed than they
begin to see things differently, and to measure the object thus
surrounded with a tape of its own manufacture. Horner--poor, ugly,
a man neither of words nor deeds--becomes one of our great men; a
nation mourns his loss and erects his statue in the Abbey. Mr.
Bagehot gives several instances of the same kind, but he does not
mention Cellini, who is however in his own way an admirable
example.</p>
<p>You open his book--a Pharisee of the Pharisees. Lying, indeed!
Why, you hate prevarication. As for murder, your friends know you
too well to mention the subject in your hearing, except in
immediate connection with capital punishment. You are of course
willing to make some allowance for Cellini's time and place--the
first half of the sixteenth century and Italy! "Yes," you remark,
"Cellini shall have strict justice at my hands." So you say as you
settle yourself in your chair and begin to read. We seem to hear
the rascal laughing in his grave. His spirit breathes upon you from
his book--peeps at you roguishly as you turn the pages. His
atmosphere surrounds you; you smile when you ought to frown,
chuckle when you should groan, and--oh, final triumph!--laugh aloud
when, if you had a rag of principle left, you would fling the book
into the fire. Your poor moral sense turns away with a sigh, and
patiently awaits the conclusion of the second volume.</p>
<p>How cautiously does he begin, how gently does he win your ear by
his seductive piety! I quote from Mr. Roscoe's translation:--</p>
<p>"It is a duty incumbent on upright and credible men of all
ranks, who have performed anything noble or praiseworthy, to
record, in their own writing, the events of their lives; yet they
should not commence this honorable task before they have passed
their fortieth year. Such at least is my opinion now that I have
completed my fifty-eighth year, and am settled in Florence, where,
considering the numerous ills that constantly attend human life, I
perceive that I have never before been so free from vexations and
calamities, or possessed of so great a share of content and health
as at this period. Looking back on some delightful and happy events
of my life, and on many misfortunes so truly overwhelming that the
appalling retrospect makes me wonder how I have reached this age in
vigor and prosperity, through God's goodness I have resolved to
publish an account of my life; and ... I must, in commencing my
narrative, satisfy the public on some few points to which its
curiosity is usually directed; the first of which is to ascertain
whether a man is descended from a virtuous and ancient family.... I
shall therefore now proceed to inform the reader how it pleased God
that I should come into the world."</p>
<p>So you read on page i; what you read on page 191 is this:--</p>
<p>"Just after sunset, about eight o'clock, as this musqueteer
stood at his door with his sword in his hand, when he had done
supper, I with great address came close up to him with a long
dagger, and gave him a violent back-handed stroke, which I aimed at
his neck. He instantly turned round, and the blow, falling directly
upon his left shoulder, broke the whole bone of it; upon which he
dropped his sword, quite overcome by the pain, and took to his
heels. I pursued, and in four steps came up with him, when, raising
the dagger over his head, which he lowered down, I hit him exactly
upon the nape of the neck. The weapon penetrated so deep that,
though I made a great effort to recover it again, I found it
impossible."</p>
<p>So much for murder. Now for manslaughter, or rather Cellini's
notion of manslaughter.</p>
<p>"Pompeo entered an apothecary's shop at the corner of the
Chiavica, about some business, and stayed there for some time. I
was told he had boasted of having bullied me, but it turned out a
fatal adventure to him. Just as I arrived at that quarter he was
coming out of the shop, and his bravoes, having made an opening,
formed a circle round him. I thereupon clapped my hand to a sharp
dagger, and having forced my way through the file of ruffians, laid
hold of him by the throat, so quickly and with such presence of
mind that there was not one of his friends could defend him. I
pulled him towards me to give him a blow in front, but he turned
his face about through excess of terror, so that I wounded him
exactly under the ear; and upon repeating my blow, he fell down
dead. It had never been my intention to kill him, but blows are not
always under command."</p>
<p>We must all feel that it would never have done to have begun
with these passages; but long before the 191st page has been
reached, Cellini has retreated into his own atmosphere, and the
scales of justice have been hopelessly tampered with.</p>
<p>That such a man as this encountered suffering in the course of
his life should be matter for satisfaction to every well-regulated
mind; but somehow or other, you find yourself pitying the fellow as
he narrates the hardships he endured in the Castle of St. Angelo.
He is so symmetrical a rascal! Just hear him! listen to what he
says well on in the second volume, after the little incidents
already quoted:--</p>
<p>"Having at length recovered my strength and vigor, after I had
composed myself and resumed my cheerfulness of mind, I continued to
read my Bible, and so accustomed my eyes to that darkness, that
though I was at first able to read only an hour and a half, I could
at length read three hours. I then reflected on the wonderful power
of the Almighty upon the hearts of simple men, who had carried
their enthusiasm so far as to believe firmly that God would indulge
them in all they wished for; and I promised myself the assistance
of the Most High, as well through His mercy as on account of my
innocence. Thus turning constantly to the Supreme Being, sometimes
in prayer, sometimes in silent meditation on the divine goodness, I
was totally engrossed by these heavenly reflections, and came to
take such delight in pious meditations that I no longer thought of
past misfortunes. On the contrary, I was all day long singing
psalms and many other compositions of mine, in which I celebrated
and praised the Deity."</p>
<p>Thus torn from their context, these passages may seem to supply
the best possible falsification of the previous statement that
Cellini told the truth about himself. Judged by these passages
alone, he may appear a hypocrite of an unusually odious
description. But it is only necessary to read his book to dispel
that notion. He tells lies about other people; he repeats long
conversations, sounding his own praises, during which, as his own
narrative shows, he was not present; he exaggerates his own
exploits, his sufferings--even, it may be, his crimes: but when we
lay down his book, we feel we are saying good-by to a man whom we
know.</p>
<p>He has introduced himself to us, and though doubtless we prefer
saints to sinners, we may be forgiven for liking the company of a
live rogue better than that of the lay-figures and empty
clock-cases labeled with distinguished names, who are to be found
doing duty for men in the works of our standard historians. What
would we not give to know Julius C&aelig;sar one-half as well as we
know this outrageous rascal? The saints of the earth, too, how
shadowy they are! Which of them do we really know? Excepting one or
two ancient and modern Quietists, there is hardly one amongst the
whole number who being dead yet speaketh. Their memoirs far too
often only reveal to us a hazy something, certainly not
recognizable as a man. This is generally the fault of their
editors, who, though men themselves, confine their editorial duties
to going up and down the diaries and papers of the departed saint,
and obliterating all human touches. This they do for the "better
prevention of scandals"; and one cannot deny that they attain their
end, though they pay dearly for it.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the start I gave when, on reading some old
book about India, I came across an after-dinner jest of Henry
Martyn's. The thought of Henry Martyn laughing over the walnuts and
the wine was almost, as Robert Browning's unknown painter says,
"too wildly dear;" and to this day I cannot help thinking that
there must be a mistake somewhere.</p>
<p>To return to Cellini, and to conclude. On laying down his
Memoirs, let us be careful to recall our banished moral sense, and
make peace with her, by passing a final judgment on this desperate
sinner; which perhaps after all, we cannot do better than by
employing language of his own concerning a monk, a fellow-prisoner
of his, who never, so far as appears, murdered anybody, but of whom
Cellini none the less felt himself entitled to say:--</p>
<p>"I admired his shining qualities, but his odious vices I freely
censured and held in abhorrence."</p>

<center><b>ON THE ALLEGED OBSCURITY OF MR. BROWNING'S
POETRY</b></center>
<br>
<center>From 'Obiter Dicta'</center>
<br>
<p>In considering whether a poet is intelligible and lucid, we
ought not to grope and grub about his work in search of obscurities
and oddities, but should, in the first instance at all events,
attempt to regard his whole scope and range; to form some estimate,
if we can, of his general purport and effect, asking ourselves for
this purpose such questions as these:--How are we the better for
him? Has he quickened any passion, lightened any burden, purified
any taste? Does he play any real part in our lives? When we are in
love, do we whisper him in our lady's ear? When we sorrow, does he
ease our pain? Can he calm the strife of mental conflict? Has he
had anything to say which wasn't twaddle on those subjects which,
elude analysis as they may, and defy demonstration as they do, are
yet alone of perennial interest--</p>
<blockquote>"On man, on nature, and on human life,"</blockquote>
<p>on the pathos of our situation, looking back on to the
irrevocable and forward to the unknown? If a poet has said, or
done, or been any of these things to an appreciable extent, to
charge him with obscurity is both folly and ingratitude.</p>
<p>But the subject may be pursued further, and one may be called
upon to investigate this charge with reference to particular books
or poems. In Browning's case this fairly may be done; and then
another crop of questions arises, such as: What is the book about,
i.e., with what subject does it deal, and what method of dealing
does it employ? Is it didactical, analytical, or purely narrative?
Is it content to describe, or does it aspire to explain? In common
fairness these questions must be asked and answered, before we
heave our critical half-bricks at strange poets. One task is of
necessity more difficult than another. Students of geometry who
have pushed their researches into that fascinating science so far
as the fifth proposition of the first book, commonly called the
'Pons Asinorum' (though now that so many ladies read Euclid, it
ought, in common justice to them, to be at least sometimes called
the 'Pons Asinarum'), will agree that though it may be more
difficult to prove that the angles at the base of an isosceles
triangle are equal, and that if the equal sides be produced, the
angles on the other side of the base shall be equal, than it was to
describe an equilateral triangle on a given finite straight line;
yet no one but an ass would say that the fifth proposition was one
whit less intelligible than the first. When we consider Mr.
Browning in his later writings, it will be useful to bear this
distinction in mind.</p>
<p>Looking then at the first period, we find in its front eight
plays:--</p>
<p>1. 'Strafford,' written in 1836, when its author was twenty-four
years old, and put upon the boards of Covent Garden Theatre on the
1st of May, 1837; Macready playing Strafford, and Miss Helen Faucit
Lady Carlisle. It was received with much enthusiasm, but the
company was rebellious and the manager bankrupt; and after running
five nights, the man who played Pym threw up his part, and the
theatre was closed.</p>
<p>2. 'Pippa Passes.'</p>
<p>3. 'King Victor and King Charles.'</p>
<p>4. 'The Return of the Druses.'</p>
<p>5. 'A Blot in the 'Scutcheon.'</p>
<p>This beautiful and pathetic play was put on the stage of Drury
Lane on the 11th of February, 1843, with Phelps as Lord Tresham,
Miss Helen Faucit as Mildred Tresham, and Mrs. Stirling, still
known to us all, as Guendolen. It was a brilliant success. Mr.
Browning was in the stage-box; and if it is any satisfaction for a
poet to hear a crowded house cry "Author, author!" that
satisfaction has belonged to Mr. Browning. The play ran several
nights; and was only stopped because one of Mr. Macready's
bankruptcies happened just then to intervene. It was afterwards
revived by Mr. Phelps, during his "memorable management" of
Sadlers' Wells.</p>
<p>6. 'Colombe's Birthday.' Miss Helen Faucit put this upon the
stage in 1852, when it was reckoned a success.</p>
<p>7. 'Luria.'</p>
<p>8. 'A Soul's Tragedy.'</p>
<p>To call any of these plays unintelligible is ridiculous; and
nobody who has ever read them ever did, and why people who have not
read them should abuse them is hard to see. Were society put upon
its oath, we should be surprised to find how many people in high
places have not read 'All's Well that Ends Well,' or 'Timon of
Athens'; but they don't go about saying these plays are
unintelligible. Like wise folk, they pretend to have read them, and
say nothing. In Browning's case they are spared the hypocrisy. No
one need pretend to have read 'A Soul's Tragedy'; and it seems,
therefore, inexcusable for any one to assert that one of the
plainest, most pointed and piquant bits of writing in the language
is unintelligible. But surely something more may be truthfully said
of these plays than that they are comprehensible. First of all,
they are <i>plays</i>, and not <i>works</i>--like the dropsical
dramas of Sir Henry Taylor and Mr. Swinburne. Some of them have
stood the ordeal of actual representation; and though it would be
absurd to pretend that they met with that overwhelming measure of
success our critical age has reserved for such dramatists as the
late Lord Lytton, the author of 'Money,' the late Tom Taylor, the
author of 'The Overland Route,' the late Mr. Robertson, the author
of 'Caste,' Mr. H. Byron, the author of 'Our Boys,' Mr. Wills, the
author of 'Charles I.,' Mr. Burnand, the author of 'The Colonel,'
and Mr. Gilbert, the author of so much that is great and glorious
in our national drama; at all events they proved themselves able to
arrest and retain the attention of very ordinary audiences. But who
can deny dignity and even grandeur to 'Luria,' or withhold the meed
of a melodious tear from 'Mildred Tresham'? What action of what
play is more happily conceived or better rendered than that of
'Pippa Passes'?--where innocence and its reverse, tender love and
violent passion, are presented with emphasis, and yet blended into
a dramatic unity and a poetic perfection, entitling the author to
the very first place amongst those dramatists of the century who
have labored under the enormous disadvantage of being poets to
start with.</p>
<p>Passing from the plays, we are next attracted by a number of
splendid poems, on whose base the structure of Mr. Browning's fame
perhaps rests most surely,--his dramatic pieces; poems which give
utterance to the thoughts and feelings of persons other than
himself, or as he puts it when dedicating a number of them to his
wife:--</p>
<blockquote>"Love, you saw me gather men and women,<br>
Live or dead, or fashioned by my fancy,<br>
Enter each and all, and use their service,<br>
Speak from every mouth the speech--a poem;"</blockquote>
<p>or again in 'Sordello':--</p>
<blockquote>"By making speak, myself kept out of view,<br>
The very man as he was wont to do."</blockquote>
<p>At a rough calculation, there must be at least sixty of these
pieces. Let me run over the names of a very few of them. 'Saul,' a
poem beloved by all true women; 'Caliban,' which the men, not
unnaturally perhaps, often prefer. The 'Two Bishops': the
sixteenth-century one ordering his tomb of jasper and basalt in St.
Praxed's Church, and his nineteenth-century successor rolling out
his post-prandial <i>Apologia</i>. 'My Last Duchess,' the
'Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister,' 'Andrea del Sarto,' 'Fra Lippo
Lippi,' 'Rabbi Ben Ezra,' 'Cleon,' 'A Death in the Desert,' 'The
Italian in England,' and 'The Englishman in Italy.'</p>
<p>It is plain truth to say that no other English poet, living or
dead, Shakespeare excepted, has so heaped up human interest for his
readers as has Robert Browning....</p>
<p>Against these dramatic pieces the charge of unintelligibility
fails as completely as it does against the plays. They are all
perfectly intelligible; but--and here is the rub--they are not easy
reading, like the estimable writings of the late Mrs. Hemans. They
require the same honest attention as it is the fashion to give to a
lecture of Professor Huxley's or a sermon of Canon Liddon's; and
this is just what too many persons will not give to poetry.
They</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Love to hear<br>
A soft pulsation in their easy ear;<br>
To turn the page, and let their senses drink<br>
A lay that shall not trouble them to think."</blockquote>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Next to these dramatic pieces come what we may be content to
call simply poems: some lyrical, some narrative. The latter are
straightforward enough, and as a rule full of spirit and humor; but
this is more than can always be said of the lyrical pieces. Now,
for the first time in dealing with this first period, excluding
'Sordello,' we strike difficulty. The Chinese puzzle comes in. We
wonder whether it all turns on the punctuation. And the awkward
thing for Mr. Browning's reputation is this, that these bewildering
poems are for the most part very short. We say awkward, for it is
not more certain that Sarah Gamp liked her beer drawn mild than it
is that your Englishman likes his poetry cut short; and so,
accordingly, it often happens that some estimable paterfamilias
takes up an odd volume of Browning his volatile son or moonstruck
daughter has left lying about, pishes and pshaws! and then, with an
air of much condescension and amazing candor, remarks that he will
give the fellow another chance, and not condemn him unread. So
saying, he opens the book, and carefully selects the very shortest
poem he can find; and in a moment, without sign or signal, note or
warning, the unhappy man is floundering up to his neck in lines
like these, which are the third and final stanza of a poem called
'Another Way of Love':--</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And after, for pastime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If June be refulgent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flowers in completeness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All petals, no
prickles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delicious as
trickles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wine poured at mass-time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And choose One
indulgent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To redness and sweetness;<br>
Or if with experience of man and of spider,<br>
She use my June lightning, the strong insect-ridder<br>
To stop the fresh spinning,--why June will consider."</blockquote>
<p>He comes up gasping, and more than ever persuaded that
Browning's poetry is a mass of inconglomerate nonsense, which
nobody understands--least of all members of the Browning
Society.</p>
<p>We need be at no pains to find a meaning for everything Mr.
Browning has written. But when all is said and done--when these few
freaks of a crowded brain are thrown overboard to the sharks of
verbal criticism who feed on such things--Mr. Browning and his
great poetical achievement remain behind to be dealt with and
accounted for. We do not get rid of the Laureate by quoting:--</p>
<blockquote>"O darling room, my heart's delight,<br>
Dear room, the apple of my sight,<br>
With thy two couches soft and white<br>
There is no room so exquisite--<br>
No little room so warm and bright<br>
Wherein to read, wherein to write;"</blockquote>
<p>or of Wordsworth by quoting:--</p>
<blockquote>"At this, my boy hung down his head:<br>
He blushed with shame, nor made reply,<br>
And five times to the child I said,<br>
"'Why, Edward? tell me why?'"</blockquote>
<p>or of Keats by remembering that he once addressed a young lady
as follows:--</p>
<blockquote>"O come, Georgiana! the rose is full blown,<br>
The riches of Flora are lavishly strown:<br>
The air is all softness and crystal the streams,<br>
The west is resplendently cloth&egrave;d in beams."</blockquote>
<p>The strength of a rope may be but the strength of its weakest
part; but poets are to be judged in their happiest hours, and in
their greatest works.</p>
<p>The second period of Mr. Browning's poetry demands a different
line of argument; for it is, in my judgment, folly to deny that he
has of late years written a great deal which makes very difficult
reading indeed. No doubt you may meet people who tell you that they
read 'The Ring and the Book' for the first time without much mental
effort; but you will do well not to believe them. These poems are
difficult--they cannot help being so. What is 'The Ring and the
Book'? A huge novel in twenty thousand lines--told after the method
not of Scott but of Balzac; it tears the hearts out of a dozen
characters; it tells the same story from ten different points of
view. It is loaded with detail of every kind and description: you
are let off nothing. As with a schoolboy's life at a large school,
if he is to enjoy it at all, he must fling himself into it, and
care intensely about everything--so the reader of 'The Ring and the
Book' must be interested in everybody and everything, down to the
fact that the eldest daughter of the counsel for the prosecution of
Guido is eight years old on the very day he is writing his speech,
and that he is going to have fried liver and parsley for his
supper.</p>
<p>If you are prepared for this, you will have your reward; for the
<i>style</i>, though rugged and involved, is throughout, with the
exception of the speeches of counsel, eloquent and at times superb;
and as for the <i>matter</i>, if your interest in human nature is
keen, curious, almost professional--if nothing man, woman, or child
has been, done, or suffered, or conceivably can be, do, or suffer,
is without interest for you; if you are fond of analysis, and do
not shrink from dissection--you will prize 'The Ring and the Book'
as the surgeon prizes the last great contribution to comparative
anatomy or pathology.</p>
<p>But this sort of work tells upon style. Browning has, I think,
fared better than some writers. To me, at all events, the step from
'A Blot in the 'Scutcheon' to 'The Ring and the Book' is not so
marked as is the <i>mauvais pas</i> that lies between 'Amos Barton'
and 'Daniel Deronda.' But difficulty is not obscurity. One task is
more difficult than another. The angles at the base of the
isosceles triangles are apt to get mixed, and to confuse us
all--man and woman alike. 'Prince Hohenstiel' something or another
is a very difficult poem, not only to pronounce but to read; but if
a poet chooses as his subject Napoleon III.--in whom the cad, the
coward, the idealist, and the sensualist were inextricably
mixed--and purports to make him unbosom himself over a bottle of
Gladstone claret in a tavern at Leicester Square, you cannot expect
that the product should belong to the same class of poetry as Mr.
Coventry Patmore's admirable 'Angel in the House.'</p>
<p>It is the method that is difficult. Take the husband in 'The
Ring and the Book.' Mr. Browning remorselessly hunts him down,
tracks him to the last recesses of his mind, and there bids him
stand and deliver. He describes love, not only broken but breaking;
hate in its germ; doubt at its birth. These are difficult things to
do either in poetry or prose, and people with easy, flowing
Addisonian or Tennysonian styles cannot do them.</p>
<p>I seem to overhear a still, small voice asking, But are they
worth doing? or at all events, is it the province of art to do
them? The question ought not to be asked. It is heretical, being
contrary to the whole direction of the latter half of this century.
The chains binding us to the rocks of realism are faster riveted
every day; and the Perseus who is destined to cut them is, I
expect, some mischievous little boy at a Board-school. But as the
question has been asked, I will own that sometimes, even when
deepest in works of this, the now orthodox school, I have been
harassed by distressing doubts whether after all this enormous
labor is not in vain; and wearied by the effort, overloaded by the
detail, bewildered by the argument, and sickened by the pitiless
dissection of character and motive, have been tempted to cry aloud,
quoting--or rather, in the agony of the moment,
misquoting--Coleridge:--</p>
<blockquote>"Simplicity--thou better name<br>
Than all the family of Fame."</blockquote>
<p>But this ebullition of feeling is childish and even sinful. We
must take our poets as we do our meals--as they are served up to
us. Indeed, you may, if full of courage, give a cook notice, but
not the time-spirit who makes our poets. We may be sure--to
appropriate an idea of the late Sir James Stephen--that if Robert
Browning had lived in the sixteenth century, he would not have
written a poem like 'The Ring and the Book'; and if Edmund Spenser
had lived in the nineteenth century he would not have written a
poem like the 'Faerie Queene.'</p>
<p>It is therefore idle to arraign Mr. Browning's later method and
style for possessing difficulties and intricacies which are
inherent to it. The method at all events has an interest of its
own, a strength of its own, a grandeur of its own. If you do not
like it you must leave it alone. You are fond, you say, of romantic
poetry; well, then, take down your Spenser and qualify yourself to
join "the small transfigured band" of those who are able to take
their Bible-oaths they have read their 'Faerie Queene' all through.
The company, though small, is delightful, and you will have plenty
to talk about without abusing Browning, who probably knows his
Spenser better than you do. Realism will not for ever dominate the
world of letters and art--the fashion of all things passeth
away--but it has already earned a great place: it has written
books, composed poems, painted pictures, all stamped with that
"greatness" which, despite fluctuations, nay, even reversals of
taste and opinion, means immortality.</p>
<p>But against Mr. Browning's later poems it is sometimes alleged
that their meaning is obscure because their grammar is bad. A cynic
was once heard to observe with reference to that noble poem 'The
Grammarian's Funeral,' that it was a pity the talented author had
ever since allowed himself to remain under the delusion that he had
not only buried the grammarian, but his grammar also. It is
doubtless true that Mr. Browning has some provoking ways, and is
something too much of a verbal acrobat. Also, as his witty
parodist, the pet poet of six generations of Cambridge
undergraduates, reminds us:--</p>
<blockquote>He loves to dock the smaller parts of speech,<br>
As we curtail the already cur-tailed cur."</blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps permissible to weary a little of his <i>i'</i>s
and <i>o'</i>s, but we believe we cannot be corrected when we say
that Browning is a poet whose grammar will bear scholastic
investigation better than that of most of Apollo's children.</p>
<p>A word about 'Sordello.' One half of 'Sordello,' and that, with
Mr. Browning's usual ill-luck, the first half, is undoubtedly
obscure. It is as difficult to read as 'Endymion' or the 'Revolt of
Islam,' and for the same reason--the author's lack of experience in
the art of composition. We have all heard of the young architect
who forgot to put a staircase in his house, which contained fine
rooms, but no way of getting into them. 'Sordello' is a poem
without a staircase. The author, still in his twenties, essayed a
high thing. For his subject--</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"He singled out<br>
Sordello compassed murkily about<br>
With ravage of six long sad hundred years.'"</blockquote>
<p>He partially failed; and the British public, with its accustomed
generosity, and in order, I suppose, to encourage the others, has
never ceased girding at him because forty-two years ago he
published at his own charges a little book of two hundred and fifty
pages, which even such of them as were then able to read could not
understand.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
